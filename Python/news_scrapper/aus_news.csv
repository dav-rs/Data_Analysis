Summary of today's events,"And with that, we’ll be closing the blog for today. Thanks to you for reading, and to Amy Remeikis for running it earlier. What happened today: Victorian premier Daniel Andrews announced a new $4,957 on-the-spot fine, its largest fine, for those breaching isolation rules, as well as a permit system for essential workers. He also said police had been given “extraordinary powers” and that an additional 500 Australian Defence Force personnel would be sent to Melbourne. And people in self-isolation have been banned from leaving their home to exercise, after 800 people out of 3,000 could not be found at home during spot-checks. The federal aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, refused to publicly release a list of aged care homes in Victoria battling outbreaks due to “reputational issues” for the facilities.

Queensland to remove hotel quarantine exemptions,"Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced she will remove all hotel quarantine exemptions that exist for diplomats, effective from Wednesday. Earlier, Palaszczuk had said she would wait to raise the issue at national cabinet on Friday, but she has just told reporters she could not wait. The decision comes after a man in his 20s with Covid-19 was allowed to enter Queensland, and go to the Sunshine Coast, using diplomatic paperwork that meant he could avoid two weeks’ isolation. It has been revealed that the man was not a consular staff member, as initially reported, but is a private security contractor. AAP reported Palaszczuk as saying: We are now in a situation where we need these loopholes closed. It is not too much to be asking people who are returning from overseas to do the mandatory quarantining. The ban would come in to effect from Wednesday, it reported. The man flew from Kabul to Sydney, then onto the Sunshine Coast on Friday, with an exemption provided by the NSW"
Victoria reports 11 deaths and 439 new infections – as it happened,"With less than 48 hours until childcare attendance rates are set to plummet in Melbourne, providers say they need urgent clarity and support from the state and federal governments. From Thursday, only parents from “defined industries” will be allowed to send their children to childcare – but there has been no word on which families will qualify. Matilda Boseley has the story:"
Liberal senator says she has experienced issues with Victorian contact tracing,"The Victorian Liberal senator Sarah Henderson says she has personally experienced issues with the state’s contact tracing efforts. Today marks her 10th day of self-isolation at home because she had been in contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case. In an interview with Sky News this afternoon, Henderson said she had received a message the other day that contained the wrong date. She also said she had received two phone calls within the space of half an hour from contract tracers, indicating that there was a problem with the system that the first call may not have been logged. Henderson said, however, she had recently had a knock on the door from the state health department and Australian defence force, which was “very impressive to see”. “It’s absolutely imperative that Victorians do the right thing.”
Henderson said she had raised the issue of people in self-isolation being allowed out to exercise with her contact tracing team last week. Henderson said it was a case of confusing messaging"
Paul Keating says young people worse off than previous generations,"Earlier today, former prime minister Paul Keating had some choice words on the government’s decision to allow people to access their superannuation during the pandemic. He made the point that young people were already in a worse situation than previous generations because they had not had the benefit of a pay rise since 2013, were saddled with Hecs debts and had to pay GST and rent. Keating said: They lose all the compounding – the $20,000 would have multiplied itself by five and a half or six times over their lifetime, so it’s been a very poor choice to them. Now their pool of savings has been lost to them when in fact it should have been public support from the get-go."
Morrison to speak with PNG PM over Covid response,"Scott Morrison says he and his counterpart in Papua New Guinea will hold talks tomorrow to discuss the impacts of Covid-19 on the region. The talks come amid growing concerns about the potential for the Covid-19 outbreak to overwhelm PNG’s health system. The Australian government announced last week that it was sending an Ausmat medical team to PNG to help with the response. As of last week, PNG had reported 63 cases, with 52 of those – more than 80% – had been in the previous two weeks. In a statement issued a short time ago, Morrison said he would hold a virtual summit tomorrow with the prime minister of PNG, James Marape.
Morrison said the countries supported each other “as a family”, citing PNG’s provision of help with Australia’s bushfire recovery and Australia’s ongoing support to help PNG “overcome the shared challenge of the Covid-19 global pandemic”. Discussions during the virtual summit will focus on the impacts of Covid-19 on our region and strategies for economic recovery. "

Uluru  Flights suspended after Indigenous community forms park blockade fearing Covid-19 risk ,"Flights to Uluru have been suspended after the Mutitjulu Aboriginal community, worried about the risk to locals from visitors flying in from interstate Covid-19 hotspots, blockaded the gates to the park. The 39 tourists who arrived at the Yulara resort on Saturday on a Jetstar flight will now be flown back to Brisbane. The blockade, by the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation (MCAC) forced Parks Australia to close the gates before they met with the Yulara resort managers, Voyages, the Mutitjulu community and traditional owners in an effort to resolve the standoff. The blockade followed the arrival of a Jetstar flight from Brisbane on Saturday with 42 passengers on board. Brisbane was declared a coronavirus hotspot on Friday evening. On arrival, under the Northern Territory’s strict Covid regulations, three passengers were taken to Alice Springs for mandatory quarantine, but the other 39 passengers were taken to the Yulara resort. Members of the Mutitjulu community said they would maintain the blockade at the gates of Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park until the 39 visitors were tested for Covid-19 and given the all-clear. “People are just sitting here, waiting to hear whether the people currently at the Yulara resort will get tested,” the MCAC chief executive, Thalia Bohl-van den Boogaard, said. “We are just waiting for confirmation that testing can be done, then the park can reopen.” But the Voyages resort chief executive, Grant Hunt, later said the guests who were currently at Yulara would be flown home on Thursday. “As we have now agreed to arrange for those guests to depart by Thursday, there is not enough time to undertake Covid testing and get results,” Hunt said. “The park will at this stage stay closed so none of those guests will have entered the park during their stay. “Voyages understands the community’s concerns and will continue to work collaboratively with the NT government, Parks Australia and the Mutitjulu Community Aboriginal Corporation to ensure all necessary precautions are being undertaken to protect the local community.” Jetstar confirmed Thursday’s flight from Brisbane to collect the tourists would be the last to Uluru for some time. A spokesman said the small number of affected customers who had booked to travel would be contacted and offered options. Flights between Brisbane and Uluru are part of the federal government’s minimum “viable network” to keep communities connected and deliver medical supplies and mail, he said. The NT opened its borders to interstate travellers on 17 July provided they do not come from a Covid hotspot. People who arrive at Uluru by road who meet this criteria are welcome, Bohl-van den Boogard said. Under the NT’s border regulations, anyone who has been to a declared Covid-19 hotspot – which includes Victoria, Sydney and Brisbane – must do 14 days mandatory supervised quarantine on arrival. “There will be no more planes landing in Yulara from Covid hotspots,” MCAC CEO, Thalia Bohl-van den Boogaard said. The Aboriginal community of Mutitjulu is inside the park and has expressed concern in the past about the vulnerability of community members – considered some of the people most at risk of the worst outcomes from contracting the virus – who frequently visit the Yulara resort to shop and for their medical needs. Last week, MCAC called for the closure of Yulara airport and the suspension of flights which it said pose an unacceptable health risk to the community. “Those people who want to fly here should just not come because we don’t want that pika (sickness) here,” MCAC chair Gloria Moneymoon said in a statement. MCAC director Craig Woods said flights to Yulara defeated the purpose of keeping people from hotspots contained. “People’s lives are more important than money,” Woods said. The chair of the Uluru-Kata Tjuta national park board of management, Sidney James, said Voyages and the Northern Territory government needed to “slow down and work together with Anangu and Parks Australia”. “This is Anangu land and lives,” James said. A Parks Australia spokesperson said Uluru-Kata Tjuta will remain closed “until traditional owners are comfortable with the travel measures put in place by the Northern Territory government and Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia”."

Melbourne  Police officer allegedly brutally bashed by anti-masker ,"A Victoria police officer allegedly had her head repeatedly bashed into concrete by a woman who police say refused to wear a mask in line with coronavirus rules. The 26-year-old officer and her partner approached a woman about 5pm on Monday at a Frankston shopping centre who was not wearing a mask and the confrontation turned violent, the chief commissioner, Shane Patton, said. “They approached a 38-year-old woman, who wasn’t wearing a mask. After a confrontation and being assaulted by that woman, those police officers went to ground and there was a scuffle,” he told reporters on Tuesday. “This 38-year-old woman smashed the head of the policewoman several times into a concrete area on the ground. The woman was taken to a police station, charged with assaulting police, recklessly causing injury, two counts of assaulting an emergency worker, two counts of resisting an emergency worker on duty and refusing to state her name and address. She was also fined $200 for not wearing a mask and bailed due to no criminal history. The police officer received significant head injuries and was taken to the Frankston hospital for assessment and medical treatment. Victoria police issued 161 fines on Monday to people flouting coronavirus restrictions, including 60 people who were not wearing masks. There were nine fines issued at vehicle checkpoints, with 22,091 checks carried out. Patton said on at least four occasions in the past week, police had to smash car windows and pull people out because they were refusing to provide personal details in line with public health guidelines. Other people fined on Monday include someone trying to buy a car after the 8pm curfew and another who was bored and wanted to go for a drive. Police conducted 6,033 spot checks on people at homes, businesses and public places in the past 24 hours across Victoria."

Coronavirus live news: UN warns of 'catastrophe' over school closures; France says second wave likely,"A World Health Organization (WHO) team in China to probe the origins of Covid-19 had “extensive discussions” and exchanges with scientists in Wuhan where the outbreak was first detected, a spokesperson for the global health organisation has said. The talks included updates on animal health research, he said. China shut down a wildlife market in Wuhan at the start of the outbreak, a day after discovering some patients were vendors or dealers. The WHO says the virus most likely came from bats and probably had another, intermediary animal “host”. The results of the WHO investigation are keenly awaited by scientists and governments around the world, none more so than Washington, which lobbied hard for the mission.
“The team had extensive discussions with Chinese counterparts and received updates on epidemiological studies, biologic and genetic analysis and animal health research,” Christian Lindmeier told reporters, saying these included video discussions with Wuhan virologists and scienti"
Germany football league 'ready' for fans to return,"Germany’s football league is ready for fans to return to the Bundesliga if authorities give the go-ahead, according to football officials. The league’s 36 professional clubs have decided on a uniform procedure for the possible return of some fans to the stadiums, Die Zeit reports. This includes a ban on alcohol, the temporary cancellation of ticket quotas for away fans and standing room, as well as the introduction of personalised tickets as a means of tracking infections. Christian Seifert, the CEO of the German football league, is taking part in a press conference now following an extraordinary meeting of clubs to discuss the measures."
Danish state epidemiologist advises against lockdown easing,"Denmark’s state epidemiologist on Tuesday said he could not recommend proceeding to the next phase of reopening society during the coronavirus outbreak, Danish media outlet Ingenioeren has reported. “It is not something that I can recommend from a healthcare perspective that you go ahead with,” Kare Molbak, director of Statens Serum Institut (the state serum institute) said according to Ingenioeren. The government and parliament are due to begin discussing the fourth phase of reopening, including nightclubs, this month. The weekly number of people infected with Covid-19 in Denmark has risen in the past couple of weeks."
Poland reports record daily increase for fourth time in a week,"Poland has reported record daily increase in coronavirus cases for the fourth time in a week, with more than a third of them found in the southern Silesia region, which has been grappling with another outbreak among coal miners. The latest tally of 680 new infections and six deaths comes as Poland considers introducing stricter restrictions, including mandatory testing for travellers returning to Poland and quarantine for those coming from certain countries. More than 220 cases were reported in Silesia, where a rapid spread of infections led to a temporary reduction of coal output and work in 12 mines in June."
Iran confirms highest single-day infections count,"Iran confirmed Tuesday over 2,700 new Covid-19 infections, its highest single-day count in more than a month, as the health ministry called for those without masks to be fined. Deaths and infections from the novel coronavirus have been on a rising trajectory in the Islamic republic since hitting a months-long low in May, reports AFP. This has prompted Iran to make wearing masks mandatory in enclosed spaces and reimpose restrictions lifted gradually since April to reopen the economy. Despite the rule, people without masks can still be seen inside the capitals’ shops and banks, and state television often criticises them for doing so. “In the past 24 hours, new confirmed cases were reported to be 2,751,” health ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said in televised remarks. The number is the highest since June 5, when the ministry reported 2,886 infections in one day."

Superannuation  Paul Keating attacks Covid-19 withdrawal scheme as unfair burden on young ,"Paul Keating has lashed the Morrison government’s decision to allow people to draw down on their superannuation due to the coronavirus crisis, saying that the decision forced young people to bear the brunt of bailing out the economy and robbed them of their retirement income. Speaking at an industry super event on Tuesday, the former prime minister and architect of Australia’s super system also attacked the legitimacy of a Treasury inquiry into retirement income and slammed “baby-faced” government backbenchers who have been campaigning against an increase to employer contributions. Rules announced in March by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, allowed workers hit by the crisis to draw as much as $20,000 from their super – a move that funds say has resulted in hundreds of thousands of people, many of them young, completely draining their accounts. “Of the income support in Australia to date, in this Covid emergency, $32bn has been found and paid for by the most vulnerable, lowest-paid people in the country – that’s the people who’ve taken the $20,000 out – and $30bn has been provided by the commonwealth under jobseeker and jobkeeper,” Keating said. “The main burden of income support is people ratting their own savings to the tune of where now 600,000 young people, broadly young people under 35, have no superannuation accounts at all now. “They lose all the compounding – the $20,000 would have multiplied itself by five and a half or six times over their lifetime, so it’s been a very poor choice to them.” He said the burden fell on young people who were already in a worse situation than previous generations because they had not had the benefit of a pay rise since 2013, were saddled with Hecs debts and had to pay GST and rent. “Now their pool of savings has been lost to them when in fact it should have been public support from the get-go,” he said. Keating repeated his support for increasing employer contributions, known as the “super guarantee”, by half a percentage point a year, bringing the current rate of 9.5% up to 12% by 2025. He dismissed the idea employers could not afford the increase, saying they had banked almost 10% reaped from the increased productivity of workers since 2013, without handing any back as pay rises. “What we’re saying is, there’s 10% labour productivity banked on the balance sheets of companies, we’re asking for a quarter of it back.” He said “so-called economic commentators” made similar arguments that increasing the rate was unaffordable when the guarantee was increased by a point a year in the early 1990s, as Australia emerged from recession. “Well of course the SG was completely affordable, we had the profit share in the economy rising, as we did the wage share,” he said. He said that at half a percentage point a year, the currently legislated increase was far smaller than wage rises handed out to low-income workers by the industrial umpire. “In the blink of an eye you’d miss it,” he said. “It’s so completely affordable.” Increasing the rate is currently both government policy and the law, but the idea has been under heavy attack from a group of government backbenchers, as well as the business lobby. “It is L-A-W and that is good,” Keating said – a reference to tax cuts he legislated before the 1993 election but repealed after winning another term in government. “There’s no economic case for it not to go ahead, none.” He said the argument against was being run by “these first-term senators, who are a particularly modest form of political life”. “But they’re out there, commanding a half-page every time they want to in the Financial Review or the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Age, the old Fairfax papers.” He said business opponents of industry super were “the establishment seeking to keep the existing order of board management through a group of non-executive directors” and were supported by some in the media. Non-executive directors got “a very bad reference” from the banking royal commission, he said. “Now, the Financial Review, which has run the case against industry funds, and its editor, Michael Stutchbury, he’s happy with the status quo. He has these soirees every month where all the non-executive directors turn up. “We don’t want any reform of the capital system, we want a sub-performing stock market, sub-performing economies, and if an industry fund says, ‘Look, we might buy … 20% of Boral or 18% of BHP because we want to improve, we want a board position and we want to improve the performance of the company on a long-term basis for our members,’ some members of the Liberal party regard this as shocking, but not just them but the whole defensive media structure of the Financial Review variety.” “Stutchbury wants to remain king of the kids, he’s got the non-executive directors turning up once a month, he gives them a cup of tea and a scone. “This sort of low-grade, modest-grade corporate performance by these non-executive directors is promoted by Australia’s principal financial newspaper.” He said that while many aspects of the super system needed to be looked into, Treasury’s retirement income review had no mandate to examine whether raising the guarantee rate was a good idea. This was because the question of the rate increase had been picked up from a previous Productivity Commission inquiry that examined the issue even though it was not in its terms of reference. “There’s an illegitimacy from the get-go about the retirement income review looking at the 12% because the parliament has already decided on the 12%,” he said."
Aged care  Minister refuses to name Victoria nursing homes battling Covid-19 due to 'reputational' fears ,"The federal aged care minister and officials from the health department have refused to publicly release a list of aged care facilities in Victoria battling outbreaks of coronavirus because the homes are worried about “reputational issues” and could be overwhelmed by media interest. Officials have also told a Senate committee examining the Morrison government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic that Canberra was unaware of the looming crisis at the St Basil’s Home for the Aged in Fawkner in Melbourne’s north for five days because the facility didn’t report the infections. Both the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, and the former chief medical officer who is now secretary of the health department, Prof Brendan Murphy, faced questions on Tuesday about the escalating coronavirus crisis in aged care in Victoria, and whether the federal government had been sufficiently attentive to managing the risks. The Greens senator, Rachel Siewert, asked for a list of facilities in Victoria currently battling outbreaks, but the request was rebuffed by Murphy. He said the department was happy to supply that list to the committee on a confidential basis but not publicly because “some of the facilities don’t want it publicly known”. “Many of them have been open about it, and it has been in the media, but some of them have had just one staff member [infected] and the facility has been locked down and it’s been controlled and they are obviously worried about reputational issues,” Murphy said. After Siewert objected to the lack of public disclosure, Colbeck backed the secretary’s judgment. He said family members of residents in aged care in Victoria had been informed when there were outbreaks in facilities but he was “reluctant to have a public hit list”. The minister told the committee he was concerned about increasing the stress on facilities through public disclosure. Colbeck said smaller facilities were not in a position to “handle a big media influx”. Colbeck and the officials faced combative questioning from Labor, Greens and crossbench senators at the hearing about how the aged care crisis in Victoria had spiralled during July. Aged care is funded and regulated by the commonwealth. While Colbeck said he wasn’t intending to blame Victoria, he said the public health response in the state became swamped during the second wave of infections which resulted in high levels of community transmission. The minister said the crisis in aged care was a function of the high levels of community transmission because staff were coming to work when they were infected but asymptomatic, and passing the virus on to colleagues and vulnerable residents. Murphy said federal officials were not informed for five days about the outbreak in St Basil’s. “It wasn’t on our radar,” he said. Murphy also speculated that the chief health officer in Victoria may not have known there was a serious outbreak in St Basil’s until 14 July, because contact tracers were swamped with new cases. He also told the committee the Victorian government stopped using the Covidsafe app for contact tracing “for a period of time … because they were so pressured” and they hadn’t found value in it during the first wave. But, he said, the app was being used again now. Colbeck was pressed about whether the Morrison government had been sufficiently proactive in the aged care sector, or whether it was reacting to crises once they presented themselves. The minister said the government had put protocols in place in aged care from the beginning of the pandemic, but “new circumstances have evolved, and appropriately, we’ve reacted to those”. Colbeck said the government’s approach should not be “static”. Officials told the committee that as of Monday morning, 97 Victorian aged care facilities were affected in the second wave, with 657 residents and 594 staff infected. A further 25 home care services for the elderly were also impacted. Seventeen recipients of these services were infected, and 24 staff working in home care. There had been 108 fatalities. On Tuesday afternoon the deputy chief medical officer Dr Nick Coatsworth told reporters the Victorian Aged Care Response Centre, announced in July to bring together commonwealth and state government agencies, was working. “The care that [residents] are getting is exactly the standards that we would all expect for our parents or relatives in aged care facilities,” he said. But Coatsworth said infection control training for aged care workers needed to be increased. “We will be working hard to review the training, I reviewed it myself last week,” he said. “It is absolutely essential that adequate PPE [personal protective equipment] training is provided to aged care staff. This is not just a responsibility of government, of course. But a knowledge about how to practise basic infection control is something that all providers need to consider.”"
'It's not going to be easy'  Experts on what Australia must do to curb Covid's spread ,"As of 2 August Australia had been experiencing average rates (smoothed over five days given how fluctuating daily counts are) of 500 to 600 per day in Victoria – although we may have just passed the peak with numbers perhaps beginning to fall in the last few days. But we still have a long way to go. Moreover, there are anywhere between 50 to 100 “mystery” cases a day – those cases that pop up and you can’t work out where they got it from. They are concerning, as it means transmission has gone “underground” in asymptomatic cases, and it reflects out-of-control community infection. Meanwhile, New South Wales and Queensland, teetering on the precipice of community transmission, are flaring up. We know masks are effective. Interestingly, the five day average in the graph below peaks at seven days after masks became mandatory, which is exactly what would be expected. So Victoria is in stage four. We are not allowed to go out of the home more than once a day, and no more than 5km to shop for essentials only. There is even a curfew from 8pm to 5am – perhaps the premier’s way of telling us “this is serious”. Is elimination even achievable now? It is not a hard argument to run that the virus has got its hooks into too many nooks and crannies in Victoria to easily dislodge. True, it is not going to be easy. But we also know that hard lockdowns work. The case numbers, surely, will fall. And if we stay in stage four lockdown, we will eventually eliminate community transmission. The question is how long Victoria would have to stay in stage four to achieve this. We do not know the answer to this question yet. Perhaps in two to three weeks, we might have enough data to model it or hazard a guess. The issue will then become whether achieving elimination of community transmission is worth the economic and social costs of a stage four lockdown. Numbers being thrown around at the moment are of a six-week hard lockdown costing Victoria and the country about $9bn. Such costs are high. But so too is the cost of not eliminating the virus, and having to live in a spluttering economy – going in and out of lockdown – until a vaccine hopefully arrives. • Tony Blakely is a professor of epidemiology at the University of Melbourne. A New Zealand-style lockdown is likely to give the state government of Victoria a reasonable chance of eliminating community transmission of the Covid-19 virus. This was the approach a group of Australian and New Zealand researchers recommended in the Medical Journal of Australia two weeks ago. It is also what the Victorian president of the Australian Medical Association has been arguing for repeatedly. The effectiveness of a short, intense lockdown is graphically illustrated on the Oxford University Our World in Data website. The New Zealand lockdown was implemented on 26 March, at a similar time to Australia, but was much stronger (up to 96.3% on their stringency scale) compared with Australia (75.9%). In New Zealand the lockdown (effectively a “stay-at-home order”) ended on 14 May and the country then moved steadily back to near-normal operations. However, in Australia, various lockdown restrictions have remained in place in many states. A stringent lockdown must have as few exemptions as possible so that it is unambiguous and enforceable. People can only leave their homes for essentials (food, healthcare and physical activity). Essential workers need to be a tightly defined group (as they were in New Zealand during its lockdown), allowing basic functioning of society to continue. Risks can be further minimised if there is mask use in all public settings. To get everyone on board there needs to be clear government messaging around the elimination goal. In New Zealand, clear consistent messaging has been a key factor in creating and maintain public trust in government directives to adhere to lockdown measures. It would help if the Australian federal government pledged more resources to help Victoria and to also support elimination in New South Wales. Such a joined-up approach is critical as then internal state border controls can be removed. This success would then allow ideas like quarantine-free travel bubbles to be explored with other Covid-19-free jurisdictions such as New Zealand, Taiwan and various Pacific Islands. Government support is needed to minimise the lockdown’s economic impacts on small businesses – and here the New Zealand experience is also relevant. Because it achieved elimination fairly quickly, there seems to have been a much more rapid economic recovery in New Zealand than Australia (see payroll data comparisons in our work). Even ongoing community transmission at a low level with the risk of long-term restrictions and setbacks may be particularly bad for business confidence. As with the health impacts, a more stringent lockdown that achieves successful elimination might be the best long-term economic strategy as well. • Michael Baker and Nick Wilson are professors of public health at the University of Otago"
'We are all breaking down'  Melbourne towers residents feel abandoned for a second time ,"Residents of the nine Melbourne public housing towers formerly under strict, police-controlled lockdown have been left traumatised and at risk of self-harm, fearful of going outside and without support or proper sanitation, one says. Mohamed, a resident of a tower at 33 Alfred Street in North Melbourne and a support coordinator for his building, said nothing had changed in the towers since they come out of hard lockdown.  Residents were terrified of becoming infected with Covid-19 after the buildings were described by Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, as “vertical cruise ships”, Mohamed said, and many no longer felt safe, with lifts and communal areas still lacking basic sanitisation. He said he had personally come to the aid of people attempting self-harm. “A couple of coordinators like myself have had major breakdowns,” he said. “A good friend of mine lives in the towers and he is a youth worker who tested positive, and is now in hotel quarantine. “The kids in the towers are calling him [in distress], even from quarantine he’s trying to help them. It’s crazy, it’s scary, and the Department of Health still can’t guarantee to us the buildings are safe.” A spokeswoman for Victoria’s Department of Health and Human Services said mental health support was always available for anyone in the community feeling isolated or vulnerable. “We made sure mental health clinicians and support workers were onsite at public housing estates to reach out to anyone at risk of mental health issues who needed support, make referrals for further treatment and prescribe medication, as well as providing support over the phone through the Inner North coronavirus response line,” she said. “We’ve provided a $59.4m coronavirus mental health package with essential, tailored support for young public housing tenants, asylum seekers, refugees, temporary migrants and vulnerable culturally and linguistically diverse groups.” Guardian Australia understands that the department will be making more announcements in coming days on mental health support as Victoria moves to tougher restrictions to slow the spread of the virus. The health department has been working with the coroners court of Victoria to closely monitor suspected suicides across the state during the coronavirus pandemic, and there has been no increase in the frequency of suspected suicides in Victoria to date. I’ve been using triage here I was taught to use in war zones Mohamed said mental health issues in the towers had been exacerbated by the announcement by the premier, Daniel Andrews, on Sunday that Melbourne would enter stage-four restrictions, with people under curfew between 8pm and 5am for six weeks. When a police-enforced lockdown of the nine public housing towers in North Melbourne and Flemington took effect in early July, the government was criticised for failing to communicate with residents in their languages beforehand, and for the police response. The Victorian ombudsman has launched an inquiry into the lockdown, including examining the way it was communicated to residents and enforced, and whether human rights breaches occurred. But Mohamed said nothing had been learned from that lockdown when it came to announcing the city-wide stage-four restrictions: “I woke up today to 50 missed calls and messages from residents asking about the stage four and what it means.”  Eva Hussain, a translator and interpreter and director of Polaron Language Services in Melbourne, said that once again residents of the towers had been left to translate the information from the premier’s press conference and disseminate it among themselves. This also occurred after the hard lockdown of the towers was announced in July. “The announcement made by the premier yesterday was shocking to everyone but there are about 2 million Victorians who speak a language other than English at home,” she said. “And that is a very high percentage. A lot of people had no idea what was going on.” She said while information was eventually made available in multiple languages on the health department website, she had asked the office of the chief health minister to add subtitles and translation to the key parts of press conferences, and to roll out those videos across social media and non-English news channels. “People are taking things into their own hands,” she said. “There are volunteer translators and people communicating through WhatsApp, but it’s not their job and it shouldn’t be on them to do that. I’m an ex-refugee, I’m an immigrant, I know these people and they are real, they are isolated at home, and they are worried and wanting to do the right thing.” She said she was concerned that volunteer translators, while trying to do the right thing, may not always translate the most important information or do so correctly. “Everyone wants to be compliant,” Hussain said. “When we talk about ethnic and multicultural communities, people will do the right thing, but they need to know what the right thing is and what it all means. If you have poor info and it’s not coming through fast enough, they are taking matters into their own hands – and messaging can get confused in that process.” Daniel Reeders, a health promotion expert with experience working with culturally and linguistically diverse communities in Melbourne, said Victoria was still not doing enough to prevent further infections. “Cleaning companies with causal workers are working to targets and have to do a cursory job of the cleaning in the towers to meet those targets, and I’m aware of community members seeing this and raising it and not getting a response,” he said. “And then a curfew coming into effect on the same day as the press conference, with no equivalent media outreach for residents in towers and other linguistically diverse communities, is concerning.” Mohamed said all the hand-sanitiser dispensers in the towers needed to be replaced because the department had found them to be faulty. There were no infection control measures in laundry areas that had been reopened, he said. He had asked the department several times for its infection risk management plans but had received no response. “I spent a year and a bit working in aid overseas,” he said. “We did things overseas I never thought I’d do in Australia. But I’ve been using triage here I was taught to use in war zones. And I’m using those wartime strategies on residents in the middle of Melbourne. “We are treated like we know nothing, like we need things done to us or we won’t comply. But we know about infection control. I’ve seen what infectious diseases like malaria can do. I have family overseas who have had it. But no one gives a shit about us. The rest of Victoria is experiencing a small fraction of what we have been facing. “We are all breaking down in here. None of us sleep any more. I can no longer look at ceilings because I stared at the ceiling in lockdown so much. I was told I wasn’t allowed outside for fresh air. My window opened about six inches. “And now we still have infected people in here but we don’t know if communal areas are safe, and those people who are infected are still locked down, some of them for more than a month while it spreads through their whole family, and they and their kids have not been outside. Some of those kids have autism or disability. “I’ve seen journalists on Twitter say to us, ‘Thank god you have the Victorian government and you’re not in America’; thanking the Victorian government for their approach, when we have been treated like uncivilised animals without human rights.” • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14; Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 551 800; MensLine Australia 1300 789 978; Beyond Blue 1300 224 636"
Childcare  Melbourne providers say they need urgent clarity and support from government ,"With less than 48 hours until childcare attendance rates are set to plummet in Melbourne, providers say they need urgent clarity and support from the state and federal governments. From Thursday 6 July, only parents from “defined industries” will be allowed to send their children to childcare, as part of Melbourne’s stage four lockdowns. But there has been no word on which families will qualify, and what government support will be available to providers. “We are essentially at this point stumbling around in the semi-darkness,” said Ruth Harper, a coordinator at East-West Childcare in Fitzroy. “It’s impossible to plan without any real clarity of how many kids we’re likely to have. And, until we get some clarity around the funding, it’s impossible to know how we’re going to pay our staff. We are in a bit of a catch-22.” The federal education minister, Dan Tehan, fronted media on Tuesday afternoon but said the federal government would need confirmation on which workers would qualify for childcare from Victoria’s government before he could make any announcements on funding. “All options are on the table. We’re going to continue those discussions this afternoon, and my hope is that we’ll be able to announce something tomorrow, which will provide certainty for the sector for the next six weeks and beyond,” he said. But providers said they were worried this was cutting it extremely close to the deadline. “No one has come along and said, you know, ‘we will make up the difference [in fees]’ or ‘this is what will happen’. We are supposed to make changes Thursday and it’s Tuesday,” Harper said. Unlike many other industries that will be required to shut down or drastically reduce staff as part of the new lockdowns, the childcare sector does not have access to jobseeker. Originally, around 40% of the industry was ineligible for the scheme, so when the free childcare system ended in July, the federal government replaced jobkeeper with a “transitional payment”, intended to be more equitable. This was around 25% of a centre’s total income per week in exchange for the provider agreeing to maintain the same number of employees. However, many providers received significantly less funding with this new scheme. This hardship was compounded in Melbourne by stage three lockdowns, which saw a significant portion of children stop attending centres, and the subsequent loss of the “gap fees” from their families. Now, with the vast majority of children set to be barred from attending, providers such as Harper are unsure how they will stay afloat. “I’m probably not allowed to use the words that accurately describe how it feels. It feels, sadly, completely unsurprising,” she said. Before the pandemic, Harper’s centre cared for 25 children. Now it could have as few as three, just 12% capacity. “Two-thirds of our income is from gap fees and 80% of our outgoings is paying staff, so the mess we are in is pretty obvious,” she said. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said a team was working to create a list of workers who could access childcare, but this has yet to be released. Many questions remained unanswered, including whether both parents must be essential workers in order to be eligible for childcare. “This is exactly the point we’re trying to clarify … It’s about trying to work out what the impact will be. How many kids will be going to childcare? How many childcare workers will need to move around the community?” he said. “I don’t want to give people false hope. There will be a lot of people who would normally send their kids to childcare who will not be able to do that and I know that will hurt.” Julie Price, the chief executive of the Community Child Care Association, says her members want the federal government to provide an additional payment of 15% of total income. This is the same support package offered to Melbourne afterschool care providers when primary schools were shut down. “With that extra support and the small amount of fees that [remaining] families would be paying, services would be able to move through the next six weeks – probably eating a little into their reserves, but they’d be OK,” Price said. The childcare industry is very diverse, but Price said generally the two support payments plus the normal childcare subsidy would equate to around 80% of a provider’s normal income. But on Tuesday Tehan indicated a blanket approach to support may not be appropriate. He suggested some providers may drop below 10% attendance, while those that service more essential workers, such as centres near hospitals, will barely be impacted. Harper said half the struggle this week had been trying to comfort panicking parents. “We emailed parents in response to the announcement Sunday and just said, ‘Look, we don’t know any more. We’ll let you know as soon as we know’… There’s a lot of that support that we need to be doing and we just can’t do any of it until we know what the parameters are.”"
'Icy southerly winds'  Snow falls in Victoria and Tasmania as blast of cold weather arrives in south-east Australia ,"People in many parts of Victoria and Tasmania woke up to a snow-covered landscape on Tuesday morning as a low pressure system brings a blast of cold air to south-east Australia.

Pacific  Missing sailors stranded on remote island saved by giant SOS in the sand ,"Three Micronesian sailors stranded on a remote Pacific island have been found alive and well after a rescue team spotted their giant SOS message written into the sand on a beach. Australian and US military aircraft found the three men on tiny Pikelot Island, nearly 200km west of where they’d set off. Rescuers said they were “in good condition” with no significant injuries. The men had been missing for three days after their seven-metre skiff ran out of fuel and strayed off course. Authorities in the US territory of Guam raised the alarm on Saturday after the men failed to complete a 42km trip from Poluwat to Pulap atolls. Australia’s HMAS Canberra was sailing between Australia and Hawaii when it received the call for help. On Sunday, a helicopter from the Canberra spotted the giant SOS, close to a small makeshift shelter on the beach, and it landed on the tiny island to check the men’s condition and give them food and water. “I am proud of the response and professionalism of all on board as we fulfil our obligation to contribute to the safety of life at sea wherever we are in the world,” Canberra’s commanding officer Captain Terry Morrison said. A Micronesian patrol vessel is sailing to the island to pick up the men. The Federated States of Micronesia, in the western Pacific, consist of more than 600 small islands scattered over a massive expanse of ocean. Uninhabited Pikelot Island, less than half a kilometre long, is a low coral atoll, heavily forested and home to a seabird rookery and turtle nesting site. In 2016, a couple stranded on the uninhabited Micronesian island of East Fayu for a week were found by the US navy after writing a big SOS in the sand."
UNSW  Lecturer says foreign students need clarity on 'academic freedom' after row over Hong Kong article ,"The University of New South Wales needs to clarify for foreign students “what academic freedom in Australia means”, the director of Human Rights Watch, Elaine Pearson, has said, after the university partially removed an article about Hong Kong from its website and deleted a Twitter post promoting it. The controversy followed complaints from Chinese students, a campaign on Weibo and articles criticising the university in the state-owned newspaper the Global Times. The article has now been reinstated on the law faculty news page, but not on the main university website. Pearson, who is an adjunct lecturer at the university, commented in the article on the imposition of China’s National Security Law in Hong Kong, saying: “Liberal democracies who are concerned about these extraordinary actions, that really fly in the face of Hong Kong’s basic law, need to call out the Chinese government for what they are doing.” Pearson did not write the article, but was interviewed by the university’s media team, who had approached her for her views. “I am worried that some students or Chinese Communist party supporters can bully the university into removing this sort of material,” Pearson told the Guardian. “Obviously standing up for human rights is not something that is controversial in Australia,” she said. “The university needs to clarify for foreign students what academic freedom in Australia means.” The education minister, Dan Tehan, declined to comment directly on the case on Monday, but said in a statement that freedom of speech was “a pillar of our democracy”. “Universities should be institutions that protect freedom of speech, debate and the challenge of ideas.” The controversy has raised new fears about how Australian universities are responding to renewed political and financial pressures due to Covid-19. UNSW, which is heavily dependent on international student revenue, announced last month it was cutting 493 jobs and faced a budget shortfall of $370m in 2021. The university has said the Twitter post was deleted because it was “being misconstrued as representing the university”. On Monday, a spokesman for UNSW said there was “nothing remarkable” about the article, which continued to have a presence on the university’s website. But he said posting it from the corporate account of the university gave the wrong impression that the views had institutional backing. “The story remains intact consistent with our commitment to freedom of speech.” The @UNSW feed is full of quotes from academic work in a range of areas — without necessarily indicating support. Deleting was an act of taking a position on the issue, indicating a certain view is unacceptable. Pearson’s article set off a campaign via the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, over the weekend. Journalist William Yang said he had screen shots from Chinese students’ accounts calling on the Chinese consulate to intervene with the university. The university now plans to have a clear disclaimer on its Twitter account saying the views of its academics are not the views of the university."
TikTok  China hits out at US 'smash and grab' as tech row deepens ,"The US has offered China the “choice of submission or mortal combat in the tech realm”, state media in Beijing have said, as the two rival powers manoeuvred on the thorny issue of splitting up TikTok. The popular video-sharing app has joined Huawei to become a technology flashpoint, with Chinese officials and media rushing to defend it following Donald Trump’s threat of a US ban.  The US president later gave Microsoft until 15 September to make an acquisition deal with TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, and said the US Treasury should receive payment as part of the deal. As with his declaration on banning the app, he did not explain if, or how, this was possible. An editorial in the official state paper, China Daily, said China would not accept the “theft” of one of its technology companies, “and it has plenty of ways to respond if the administration carries out its planned smash and grab”. The US actions were driven by the profits in data, it said, and offered “an either-or choice of submission or mortal combat in the tech realm”. On Monday, a spokesman for China’s ministry of foreign affairs said China firmly opposed any US action against Chinese software companies over national security concerns. “The US generalises the concept of national security and, without any evidence, presumptions of guilt and threats against relevant companies,” said Wang Wenbin. “This violates the principles of market economy and exposes the hypocrisy and typical double standards of the US in maintaining fairness and freedom. It also violates the World Trade Organisation’s principles of openness, transparency and non-discrimination.” China’s ambassador to the UK, Liu Xiaoming, also accused the US of hypocrisy. “It is the US that has politicised economic issues and abused the concept of national security to pursue discriminatory and exclusive policies,” he said. Kai-Fu Lee, the former president of Google China, said the US treatment of TikTok was “unbelievable”. Lee said China set out clear rules for tech companies to comply with if they wanted to do business in the country, and Google had decided not to stay on that basis. He accused the US of giving no parameters for TikTok to work with, or providing any evidence for their national security claims. “Google didn’t want to comply with Chinese laws & regulations, so it quit,” said Lee, who added he had left the company prior to its exit from China. “Forced acquisition + only 45 days + intermediary fees are not comparable to Google. It is incredible,” he said. An editorial in China’s state-owned 21st Century Business Herald said forcing the sale would set a “dangerous precedent”. “For this transaction, the Chinese government may also consider reviewing whether the technology transfer in it violates Chinese laws and harms China’s national interests.” ByteDance has not confirmed any discussions with Microsoft, but an internal staff memo from founder Zhang Yiming addressed the speculation on Monday.  Zhang said they had cooperated with authorities on privacy concerns, and had “initiated preliminary discussions” with an unnamed tech company to allow them to keep operating in the US. Separately on Monday the company also said it was considering establishing TikTok’s headquarters outside the US.  The reports prompted some backlash on Chinese social media, with some accusing the company of surrendering to the US, which was akin “to being anti-China”. “Choose wisely on selling to the United States or becoming an enemy at home,” wrote one user.

Victoria-NSW border   Communities brace for 'enormous heartache' as lockdown measures loom ,"Communities straddling Victoria and New South Wales are bracing for “enormous heartache” and even more disruption to business, with the looming lockdown measures adding to the pain caused by last month’s border closure, a federal MP says. The independent MP for the north-east Victorian seat of Indi, Helen Haines, said many business owners were “desperate” and “exhausted” after experiencing four weeks of impacts from the NSW border restrictions – and now faced another hit from the reintroduction of stage three lockdown measures in regional Victoria this week. Haines is calling for “some very targeted federal government business support to the border communities, which recognises that they have now experienced a month of disruption to their business as a result of the border closing”. The Albury-Wodonga region, for example, has faced a range of impacts. Regional Victoria is scheduled to return to stage three stay-at-home restrictions from late on Wednesday evening, with restaurants and cafes switching back to delivery and takeaway only. The measures in regional Victoria will also result in the closure of beauty and personal services businesses along with entertainment and cultural venues, while community sport will have to stop. “Many businesses told me when the border closed that they had only just started to stand up again after the first round of restrictions,” Haines said in an interview with Guardian Australia. “I think it’s going to have a devastating impact on these border communities.” Haines added that the measures would affect “the same communities that experienced substantial impact from the Black Summer bushfires and have also been enduring drought conditions for some time”. “So I’m expecting enormous heartache … from a mental health perspective. Some businesses won’t get through this.” Haines said some business owners were “quite desperate”. She said she had heard from the operator of a hairdressing salon that her revenue had dropped 60% after just one week of the NSW border closure. The NSW government’s change to the public health order on 22 July had also caused “a world of woe” and “a lot of confusion” because it said people should only cross the border for medical services that they could not otherwise receive in their home state. “We heard of in one physiotherapy practice alone, 30 cancellations in one week from people with disabilities who were too afraid to cross the border, who were confused – and they couldn’t access their allied health services somewhere else because they’d have to change their whole NDIS plan,” Haines said. The Covid-19 crisis had exposed how the interconnected nature of border communities was poorly understood in the state capitals where key decisions were made, she said. While Albury in NSW and Wodonga in Victoria were separated by the Murray River, there was a shared economy whereby businesses operated on both sides and workers moved across the border each day. The restrictions that the NSW government had imposed were “a very blunt instrument” and had affected people on both sides of the border even though there were limited numbers of Covid-19 cases there, she said. For example, at one point as many as 80 Wangaratta doctors, nurses and other health staff were unable to attend work because of where they lived – a situation that has since been resolved by a NSW Health decision to allow healthcare staff to work beyond the so-called blue zone. But Haines said the impacts were broader than healthcare, because the economies were integrated. She said other workers were unable to go to work because of the 14-day self-isolation rule when they returned home on the other side of the border. She said while individual issues were ironed out in recent weeks, MPs representing border communities “did feel by the end of last week that both the doors and the windows had shut to NSW and that we weren’t able to negotiate much more in terms of the border closure”. With Victoria now going into harder lockdown, “our negotiating capacity is substantially reduced”. The federal government announced on Sunday that it would provide 10 additional Medicare-subsidised psychological therapy sessions for people subjected to further restrictions in areas affected by the second wave – a move Haines said was welcome. “We will need it. But what people need and, of course, what we can’t guarantee is certainty. And at the moment, that’s facing everyone in Victoria and not just the border communities,” she said. “But my central thesis is these border communities have had a month of what I would argue has been unnecessary angst because of an artificial border zone imposed by NSW. And that’s set up these businesses to be in a position of greater vulnerability than anywhere else in the regions.” The federal government announced on Monday evening that it planned to roll out a partial form of paid pandemic leave in Victoria – and it is also expected to tweak jobkeeper eligibility to account for the developing situation in Victoria. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, told reporters on Monday he understood people were feeling a range of difficult emotions over the lockdown measures, including frustration and anger, “whether they’re in metropolitan inner Melbourne or they’re out in regional Victoria where there are very few cases”. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said businesses in regional Victoria that suffered significant losses or needed to close as a result of the current restrictions could apply for a $5,000 state grant, while those in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire could apply for double that amount “in recognition of spending longer under restrictions”. A survey of businesses by the Albury Northside Chamber of Commerce – in combination with Business Wodonga – found that nearly 90% of respondents said the border closure had affected their business. Most of the respondents were businesses in Albury."
'Breach of trust'  Landmark study delves into sexual misconduct complaints made against Australia's health professions ,"Medical practitioners, psychologists, chiropractors and osteopaths comprise 22% of registered health practitioners in Australia, yet almost three-quarters of sexual misconduct complaints made to health regulators involved these professions, a world-first study has found. Led by Assoc Prof Marie Bismark, a doctor and lawyer with the University of Melbourne, the study is the first to look at official complaints of sexual misconduct across all health professions, including medical practitioners, nurses and midwives, allied health professionals, pharmacists, dentists, chiropractors, osteopaths, physiotherapists and psychologists. Medical practitioners included general practitioners and specialist doctors such as surgeons, psychiatrists, gynaecologists and paediatricians. The researchers analysed all sexual misconduct allegations made to the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra) and the New South Wales Health Professional Councils Authority between 2011 and 2016. Regulators received 1,507 sexual misconduct reports during that period, including 208 practitioners who were the subjects of more than one complaint. Alleged sexual relationships were the subject of 381 (25%) of the reports, while 1,126 (75%) of the reports related to sexual harassment or assault. Reports regarding sexual relationships were more frequent for psychiatrists, psychologists and general practitioners. The rate was higher for regional and rural than metropolitan practitioners. Notifications of sexual harassment or assault more frequently named male than female practitioners, with 88% of complaints about men, the study, to be published in the Medical Journal of Australia, found. Bismark said breaching sexual boundaries was “one of the most profound ways” in which trust could be broken. “I’ve been researching patient safety for a long time, and what we can learn from patient voices and complaints to improve health care,” she said. “Sexual misconduct is one of the most serious ways in which health practitioners can harm their patients. This is highly sensitive data and through a research partnership with Ahpra our research group was able to get this de-identified data.” Although nurses and midwives comprised 59.2% of health practitioners, they made up 19.2% of sexual misconduct complaints. “There were very few reports of sexual misconduct by nurses who are a huge group of practitioners doing very personal and intimate care,” Bismark said. “I found that very interesting and they’re obviously doing something right in their professional training and in the way they communicate with patients and respect boundaries.” When it came to medical practitioners, rates of notifications alleging sexual harassment were higher for obstetricians and gynaecologists, psychiatrists, and psychologists than for internal medicine physicians. Rates of notifications alleging sexual assault were higher for chiropractors and osteopaths, psychiatrists, and general practitioners than for internal medicine physicians. Rural and regional practitioners were more likely to enter into sexual relationships with their patients. “When you think about these professionals a common feature among the practitioners most likely to have a notification against them such as psychiatrists and general practitioners as they are more likely to have ongoing, one-to-one relationships with patients behind closed doors,” Bismark said. “It’s really rare for sexual misconduct to happen in a team-based setting, and physiotherapists and nurses usually work in a team environment.” Bismark said it was important to note that her study only captured those who made complaints to the regulators. Her previous research has found that elderly women, those from low socioeconomic backgrounds, Indigenous women or those from cultural and linguistic minority groups are the least likely to make a formal complaint. “Many, many women who have an uncomfortable experience with a doctor don’t make a report to Ahpra,” she said. “One of my concerns is when people do complain is how long it can take for these allegations to be resolved. We found a complaint about sexual misconduct would take longer on average than a clinical complaint to reach an outcome which is both stressful for the complainant and the practitioner.” In 2017 Ahpra and the Medical Board committed to wide-ranging reforms to the management of sexual misconduct cases, as recommended by the independent reviewer Prof Ron Paterson in the chaperone review report. As a result of that report, health professionals being investigated for sexual misconduct are no longer allowed to continue working accompanied by a chaperone, after the review found the measure was outdated, paternalistic and did not improve public safety. Paterson found many examples of practitioners breaching chaperone conditions. “Predatory practitioners who have come to view patients as sexual objects may not be deterred by a safety mechanism that still leaves the practitioner in control,” he found. “The mandated chaperone system keeps patients in the dark. They do not know why a chaperone is required. This is the most significant flaw in the current system.” On 31 July Ahpra published a review of how many of the recommendations made in Paterson’s report had been implemented. “Much has been achieved over the past three years,” the review found. “Nearly all 28 recommendations of the chaperone review report have been fully implemented, resulting in significant changes in regulatory practice. Nonetheless, in some cases, tribunals continue to countenance use of a chaperone condition as an immediate action, seeing it as an effective risk mitigation strategy to minimise the risk of harm to patients.” The review also found there had been a “surge” in sexual misconduct allegations made to Ahpra. The #MeToo movement and greater societal awareness of sexual abuse had likely contributed to this, the review found. But there continued to be delays in the investigation of complaints. “There is no quick fix to the problem of investigation delays,” the review found. “Ahpra faces an ongoing challenge of how best to prioritise investigation resources, given the competing demands for timely action on other conduct investigations, such as into performance concerns. However, the delays in concluding investigation of sexual boundary notifications need to be reduced, in the interest of public protection and public confidence.”"
"Siberia  Remains of 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth pulled from lake ","Russian scientists are poring over the uniquely well-preserved bones of a 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth after completing the operation to pull them from the bottom of a Siberian lake. Experts spent five days scouring the silt of Lake Pechenelava-To in the remote Yamal peninsula for the remains, which include tendons, skin and even excrement, after they were spotted by local residents. About 90% of the animal has been retrieved during two expeditions. Such finds are happening with increasing regularity in Siberia as climate change warms the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world, thawing the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost. The woolly mammoth will probably be named Tadibe, after the family who discovered the adult animal, which is thought to have been a male between 15 and 20 years old, and and about 10ft (three metres) tall. Andrey Gusev from the Centre of Arctic Research, said the preservation of the animal was unique, with the lower spine still connected by tendons and skin, but that the retrieval operation was painstaking because the remaining bones were jumbled up. “We assumed that the bones were preserved in the anatomical order. But the first and the second days of our expedition showed that it was true only about the back part of the skeleton,” he said. “The rest of the bones were in such chaotic order that it was impossible to guess where they were.” Evgenia Khozyainova from the Shemanovsky museum in Salekhard, said: “We have one front and one hind foot well-preserved, with tendons, soft tissues and pieces of skin. Also we have sacrum with adjacent vertebrae, including the tail preserved with tendons and a big piece of skin.” Of particular interest is the excrement, or coprolite, because it will contain details of the animal’s diet, as well as pollen and other environmental clues. The cause of the mammoth’s death is not clear yet as no signs of injuries were found on the bones. Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia. Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia’s Far East in 2018.

Donald Trump  New York prosecutor seeks eight years of tax returns ,"A New York prosecutor trying to access Donald Trump’s tax returns told a judge on Monday that he was justified in demanding them, citing public reports of “extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the Trump Organization”. Trump’s lawyers last month said the grand jury subpoena for the tax returns was issued in bad faith and amounted to harassment of the president. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, is seeking eight years of the Republican president’s personal and corporate tax records, but has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records, other than part of the investigation relates to payoffs to women to silence them about alleged affairs with Trump in the past. In a court filing on Monday, though, attorneys for Vance said Trump’s arguments that the subpoena was too broad stemmed from “the false premise” that the investigation was limited to so-called “hush-money” payments. “This Court is already aware that this assertion is fatally undermined by undisputed information in the public record,” Vance’s lawyers wrote. They said that information confirms the validity of a subpoena seeking evidence related to potentially improper financial transactions by a variety of individuals and entities over a period of years. They said public reporting demonstrates that at the time the subpoena was issued “there were public allegations of possible criminal activity at Plaintiff’s New York County-based Trump Organization dating back over a decade.” They added: “These reports describe transactions involving individual and corporate actors based in New York County, but whose conduct at times extended beyond New York’s borders. This possible criminal activity occurred within the applicable statutes of limitations, particularly if the transactions involved a continuing pattern of conduct.” The lawyers urged Judge Victor Marrero to swiftly reject Trump’s arguments, saying the baseless claims were threatening the investigation. Marrero, who ruled against Trump last year, has scheduled arguments to be fully submitted by mid-August. “Every day that goes by is another day Plaintiff effectively achieves the ‘temporary absolute immunity’ that was rejected by this Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court,” Vance’s lawyers said. “Every such day also increases the prospect of a loss of evidence or the expiration of limitations periods – the precise concerns that the Supreme Court observed justified its rejection of Plaintiff’s immunity claim in the first place.” The supreme court last month rejected claims by Trump’s lawyers that the president could not be criminally investigated while he was in office. Vance’s lawyers said Trump was not entitled to know the scope and nature of the grand jury investigation. But they said information already in the public domain about Trump’s business dealings provided satisfactory support for the subpoena of his tax records. They cited several newspaper articles, including one in the Washington Post examining allegations that Trump had a practice of sending out financial statements to potential business partners and banks that inflated the worth of his properties by claiming they were bigger or more potentially lucrative than they were. Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, described such practices during congressional testimony. Vance sought the tax records in part for an investigation of how Cohen arranged during the 2016 presidential race to keep the adult film producer and actor Stormy Daniels and model Karen McDougal from airing claims of extramarital affairs with Trump. Trump has denied the affairs. Cohen is serving the last two years of a three-year prison sentence in home confinement after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, among other charges. He has said he plans to publish a book critical of the president before the November election."
"Climate crisis  July rainfall across Australia dips to 43% below average, BoM reports ","Rainfall across Australia was 43% below average in July, continuing a long-term drying trend consistent with rising atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, the weather bureau says. The Bureau of Meteorology’s climate statement for July says the continent was drier than average across most of its south, from Western Australia to the south-west of New South Wales and including most of Victoria. Tasmania recorded its second-driest July on record behind 1957. South Australia had its lowest rainfall for the month since 1997. Victoria’s east and the south-coast of NSW were exceptions. Both received heavy dumps in the last week of the month as they were hit by an intense low pressure system. Several places in NSW and south-east Queensland had their wettest July day on record between 26-28, and the highest rainfall for the month in more than 20 years. Despite this, the country as a whole registered its 19th driest July since records began in 1900. Rainfall over southern Australia between April and October has dropped by 15-20% since the 1970s. Blair Trewin, a senior climatologist, said nine of the past 10 Julys had rain below the long-term average. “We definitely see a long-term downward trend in rainfall in much of southern Australia,” he said. Trewin said it was associated with a strengthening of the subtropical ridge – a belt of high pressure systems circling the southern hemisphere at midlatitudes – that has increasingly pushed westerlies that used to hit Australia further south. “There is evidence that a strengthening of the subtropical ridge is something you’d expect to see with the atmospheric forcing [due to greenhouse gases] that’s going on,” Trewin said. The dry July followed a wetter start to the year that brought much-needed rain after the hottest and driest year on record in 2019 and the horrific 2019-20 bushfire season. Trewin said it meant 2020 was still tracking close to average for total rainfall. Temperatures in July were high compared to the historical record on average. Maximum daytime temperatures across the continent were 1.54C above the average for the years 1961-1990. It made it the seventh-hottest July on record. Nights were not quite as warm relative to recent years. Average temperatures across day and night were 0.99C above the long-term, making the month the 15th hottest on record by that measure. As always, the picture varied across the country. Much of Western Australia, eastern Victoria and NSW and the Cape York Peninsula were hotter than the long-term average, but some places in South Australia and Victoria recorded their lowest July average daily temperature since modern records began. The hottest temperature of the month was recorded at Noonamah, south-east of Darwin, which hit 36.2C on the 11th. The coldest day was recorded at the snowfields of Thredbo, NSW, which reached only -2.9C on the 3rd. The night was dark and deep at Liawenee, on the banks of Great Lake in central Tasmania, on the 17th, when it fell to a national low of -9.1C."
Spain  Scandal-hit former king Juan Carlos to move abroad ,"Spain’s former king Juan Carlos is to leave the country and go into exile abroad following a series of damaging allegations about his financial arrangements that have harmed the reputation of the monarchy and embarrassed his son, King Felipe. In March Felipe stripped Juan Carlos of his annual stipend and renounced his own personal inheritance from his father after reports that he was in line to receive millions of euros from a secret offshore fund with ties to Saudi Arabia. Three months later, Spain’s supreme court launched an investigation into the former king’s role in a deal in which a Spanish consortium landed a €6.7bn (£5.9bn) contract to build a high-speed rail line between the Saudi cities of Medina and Mecca. On Monday afternoon the royal house published a letter sent by Juan Carlos to his son saying he would “move away from Spain” in the wake of the “public repercussions that certain past events in my private life are causing”. The 82-year-old king emeritus, as he is now known in Spain, said he had taken the decision to leave the royal palace and the country to help Felipe “exercise his responsibilities” as king. Juan Carlos added: “This is a very emotional decision, but one I take with great serenity. I have been king of Spain for almost 40 years and throughout them all I have always wanted what is best for Spain and the crown.” The letter did not mention where the former king would go, nor when exactly he would leave Spain. A Spanish government source said it “respected” the decision, adding the move showed “the transparency that has always guided King Felipe since he became head of state”. The royal house said Felipe had expressed its “gratitude and respect” for the decision. It also said the current king was keen to stress “the historical importance of his father’s reign” and his service to Spain and to democracy. Juan Carlos played a pivotal role in restoring democracy to Spain following the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, not least when he stood firm in the face of an attempted military coup in 1981. But in recent years the revelations about his private life and financial affairs have tarnished what was once seen as one of Europe’s model monarchies. Juan Carlos abdicated in favour of Felipe six years ago after a series of scandals including over a controversial elephant-hunting trip to Botswana as Spain was devastated by the financial crisis. Felipe’s decision to cancel his father’s stipend and forgo his personal inheritance was viewed as proof of his desire to take firm action and distance himself from the scandals. Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government has rejected calls for a parliamentary inquiry into the king’s finances, but it too has signalled its distance from Juan Carlos. “It’s obvious that collectively Spaniards are hearing some unsettling reports that disturb all of us, and which disturb me too,” the prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, said in July. “But I think there are some things worth mentioning in all this. First, that there are some media that aren’t looking the other way – on the contrary, they’re reporting all this. Second, there’s a justice system that’s taking action. Third – and this is something I’m grateful for – the royal house itself had distanced itself following these disturbing reports.” Sánchez also said the 1978 constitution – under which “the person of the king is inviolable and shall not be held accountable” – needed “to evolve in accordance with the standards and political conduct that society demands”. Swiss prosecutors are looking into a number of accounts held in the country by the former monarch and his alleged associates. It is alleged in documents from the Swiss prosecutors that Juan Carlos received a $100m “donation” from the king of Saudi Arabia that he put in an offshore account in 2008. Four years later he allegedly gifted €65m from the account to his former lover Corinna Larsen. Juan Carlos has said he never told his son he was set to benefit from two offshore funds, but he has made no further comment on the allegations."
"To Melbourne, with love  The ultimate streaming list to bring you joy in lockdown ","It’s probably fair to say that most reality TV just functions as a circus of human misery. Shows like Bachelor in Paradise and Big Brother make mockeries of their contestants, contriving impossibly mean-spirited antics from seemingly normal people. That’s part of the appeal, of course, but at a point the weight of it all can mount, the game of emotional Jenga being played with both audience and contestant crumbling in a second. Consider, then, RuPaul’s Drag Race: a reality competition show that revolutionises the format, balancing the bitchiness of its contestants with profound, avant-garde artistry; the emotional antics and convoluted twists with gob-smacking acrobatics and a refreshingly twisted sense of humour. A competition to find “America’s next drag superstar” over the course of its 17 seasons – 12 in the main show, five in its supercharged “All Stars” edition – Drag Race has become an exemplar of well-constructed reality TV, rarely sacrificing the humanity or artistry of its contestants for cheap fights or stunts. Rife in its later seasons with in-jokes and throwbacks, Drag Race is also a perfect binge-watching show, often operating by its own unique internal logic that is reliant on intimate knowledge of the program. But that’s what’s great about making it through the show’s immense canon: it can feel like an entry point into an entirely new frame of culture. At its best, the show provides a platform for some of America’s most unique and groundbreaking artists; at its worst, it’s still a reality show with spades more empathy than its closest competitor. (A tip: It’s probably best to start the show between seasons four and six, and then proceeding with the show’s main and All Stars seasons in the order in which they came out, before returning to seasons one through three.) – Shaad D’Souza I don’t know what films and shows are on the rest of this list, but I know that none of them rival Paddington. The two Paddington films are pure distillations of joy. They are flawless monuments to kindness and community. Whenever anything bad happens in my life I watch them as ritual. It’s like slowly spreading marmalade across my tired brain. Based on Michael Bond’s marmalade-loving bear of the same name, the Paddington films follow the polite cub from “darkest Peru” (voiced by Ben Whishaw) as he finds a new home in London. Unfortunately he also finds mischief and trouble at every turn. If you haven’t yet been won over by Paddington’s bumbling charms: no, these movies are not just for kids. At its release, Paddington 2 was the best reviewed film in history. I genuinely think it was robbed of a Best Picture Oscar, and I’m not alone. I could talk more about the comedy or the surprising dramatic heft or Hugh Grant’s incredible self-parodic performance as a villain, but all you really need to know about is the joy. These films are a big warm bear hug – pun absolutely intended. – Meg Watson Take it from someone who is currently crying while listening to Billy Ocean’s Get Outta My Dreams (Get Into My Car) very loud because they, who do not drive, will not be allowed inside a car with friends nor family for six weeks: stage four lockdown sucks. Intellectual rationality has been replaced by something more slippery, where the threat of economic catastrophe can be faced with a stiff upper lip but dropping your toast on the kitchen floor is enough to bring on a breakdown. As a result, I have returned to the sacred texts: two ancient YouTube rips of turn-of-the-century America’s Funniest Home Videos compilations titled, respectively, Funny Cats (2007), and the altogether less evocatively named Dogs (2006). These two videos have been my constant companions through dark times, including what was, in late 2007, the worst depressive spell of my life (prior to 2020 am I correct?!). There’s not much to tell you by way of explanation – they’re literally just a bunch of videos of dogs and cats doing silly things, set to amusing music – other than to say I am yet to meet someone whose mood cannot be lifted by an immediate (and often immediately repeated) application of Funny Cats and Dogs. In the TikTok age, there’s something reassuring in the nostalgic quality of these video snippets, with their degraded VHS tape interference and unseen camera, people’s horrified/delighted reactions (“WHOA!” “Hey—”) to, say, the cat tearing into the bathroom and leaping, unsuspecting, head first into a full bath. We may feel like everything we know and love is crumbling around us right now, with self care being torn away with each new restriction, but it pays to remember that once upon a time, all we needed to feel happiness was around 1:20 wittily edited minutes of complete, cathartic chaos. – Clem Bastow With the great British director Alan Parker having passed away on the weekend, the time is ripe to revisit his 1976 feature film debut – perhaps one of the strangest movie musicals of all time, in a genre not exactly known for fidelity to realism. The film is set in Prohibition era America and explores characters caught up in a turf war between two rival gangs, one of which gets their mitts on a “deadly” new machine gun. “Deadly” is in inverted commas because the weapons in Parker’s sweet-toothed alternate universe fire whipped cream and other dessert ingredients instead of bullets. Oh, and all the characters are children who – if all this wasn’t weird enough – have adult voices when they break into song. Bugsy Malone is nutty as a fruitcake, with an elastic tone that bends between moments of pathos – i.e. the poignant Tomorrow – to a conviviality, such as the show-stopping You Give a Little Love. That song, sang during a food fight grand finale, is a great pick-me-up, with its messages of unity (“It’s been decided, we’re weaker divided”) and of forging meaningful personal legacies (“You’re gonna be remembered for the things that you say and do”). So weird; so good! – Luke Buckmaster The undeniable truth is that The First Wives Club begins with a funeral, and I cannot change that. But once you get past the funeral, you will be treated to some absolutely delightful moments. Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler and Diane Keaton connecting over cocktails! Jokes about lip fillers! Dance sequences! Revenge on middle-aged men with wide faces! Cashmere cardigans! Maggie Smith! Sarah Jessica Parker! Therapy! This First Wives Club came out in 1996, which was the prime time for comedies about rich New Yorkers yelling at each other. It is about three college friends reuniting in their 40s to wreak revenge on their terrible ex-husbands, who have cast them aside for various deplorable reasons. This movie is very, very funny, but it’s Goldie, Bette and Diane’s friendship – and resilience in the face of people who have dismissed them for being too old, too timid or too traditional – that I find very comforting. And did I mention there was a dance sequence? – Sinéad Stubbins You might think you’re familiar with competitive cooking shows, but nothing matches the sheer, wholesome delight of The Great British Bake Off. Picture this: a dozen bakers, reflecting the geographic, age and cultural diversity of the UK, holed up in a tent in the English countryside, cooking up génoise sponges and gingerbread while the iconic Mary Berry exclaims “Marvelous!” and “Simply delightful!” between mouthfuls of shortbread. Sure, it is a competition show. But it’s free of the kind of over dramatic and confected narratives that dominate most reality TV. The bakers regularly help each other out, there’s saucy jokes, some healthy flirting and a lot of extremely delicious food. It’s my go-to comfort watch and you won’t regret making it yours. – Osman Faruqi Those harbouring a tree change fantasy maybe once got their kicks watching rural reality real estate show Escape to the Country – until something became glaringly obvious: no one was actually buying the houses. Instead, the rural real estate show we should all be watching is ABC comedy Rosehaven. Created by and starring Luke McGregor and Celia Pacquola, the show is set in the fictional Tasmanian town of Rosehaven, where McGregor’s character has returned to help run his family’s real estate business. He’s joined by his best friend, played by Pacquola, and the dynamic between the two is where the show gets its magic spark. Rosehaven isn’t demanding; it’s not serious, or issues-based. In fact, its stars have described it as “the best thing to watch when you’re hungover”. – Brigid Delaney From the minds of sitcom kings Dan Goor and Michael Schur, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has all the hallmarks of their other hit show, Parks And Recreation; just replace local government with local police and you get the gist. Sure, you could say it’s a little formulaic (you can more or less line up the characters with their Parks counterparts) but I prefer to call it comforting. Set in a Brooklyn detective precinct, B99 exists in a dream world where all cops are adorkable and woke do-gooders who solve crimes and pull off office pranks with equal enthusiasm. The whole cast, led by Andy Samberg, is utterly charming, but the show’s worth watching alone for Chelsea Peretti as Gina: the receptionist more concerned with her Twitter than fighting crime. Seven seasons in, the show remains as sharp as ever, as snowballing jokes and yearly themed episodes – such as a Halloween competition where detectives try to steal a trophy – only get bigger and better. It’s as wholesome as it is funny. – Jared Richards Strangers is an eminently likeable comedy web series about a couple of messy young queers finding their way in the world: Isobel (Zoë Chao), a somewhat anxious Eurasian bisexual who’s just been dumped by her boyfriend after cheating on him with a woman; and Cam (Meredith Hagner), her perennially cheerful white BFF who is the most wholesome Lothario you’ll ever meet. Each 10-20 minute episode then introduces new “strangers” (including some well-known faces like Jemaine Clement and Leisha Hailey) as guests staying in Isobel’s other room, who offer advice, obstacles and counterpoints as she navigates the new terrain of her post-breakup life. Created by Mia Lidofsky, the series premiered in 2017 on Facebook Watch where it’s still available to stream. It feels a bit like a west coast answer to Broad City in that the heart of the show is Isobel and Cam’s friendship, but the other relationships are satisfying too, with insider-y representations of queerness and polyamory, and big bright romances you can’t help barracking for. – Jinghua Qian After watching all six seasons of Schitt’s Creek from beginning to end, twice, in an effort to perfect my Moira accent (impossible because it is “unrecognisable”: “seems one part British/Canadian/mid-Atlantic with a retro Hollywood spin”; is sprinkled with “a kind of unhinged verbosity”; and is frankly just plain “bonkers”), I was feeling sad, defeated and lost. What could take my mind off the horrors of 2020 in the evenings before bed? What could make me laugh like Schitt’s Creek or just sit in front of the telly smiling, feeling lovely and romantic and being reminded that even if it’s just on TV, there is some good in the world? That’s when I logged onto SBS on Demand and saw to my absolute delight that all three seasons of The Family Law are now streaming. Binge-watching The Family Law – a series based on Benjamin Law’s memoir – makes it even funnier, more ridiculous and more thoroughly groundbreaking than watching an episode a week as I did the first time round. I’m finding even more thrills, scoffs and hoots than before. This family is just the trick to take my mind off the horrors going on outside. At the very heart of both of these shows is the warmth that families bring, even amid the dramas and upsets, marriages, divorces and separations; we crave families to soothe our souls and when they do – well, there’s not much better. And being trained to laugh at my own, rather than be mortified by them, is certainly a lesson I’m happily learning (sorry, mum!) – Gabrielle Jackson While there is no shortage of cooking shows, great films depicting the human love affair with food are few and far between. Thankfully, however, there’s 2001 German film Mostly Martha: a sublime and heart-warming exploration of love in and out of the kitchen (and the inspiration for the far inferior US version, No Reservations). Many of us are familiar with the tropes of romantic comedy, but the heroine is often flawed in flimsy, insignificant ways – she’s clumsy and always picks the wrong guy. This is not that story. Mostly Martha is a masterclass in character evolution, depicting the slow burn of connection for talented but single-minded chef Martha (Martina Gedeck), who is consumed by her work in the kitchen. Circumstances move her towards soulful connections with her recently-orphaned niece Maxime (Lina Klein) and a new sous-chef Mario (Sergio Castellitto), who subtly help breathe life into Martha (without “saving” her). Poignant, comical and gorgeously sensual, you will never look at pasta the same way again. – Amal Awad • For more recommendations of what to stream in Australia, head to our Stream Team column • Did we miss your favourite film or show that fits the self-soothing criteria?

  James Murdoch has left News Corp, but not much will change at the company's Australian outlets ","It seems unlikely that James Murdoch’s departure from the News Corporation board will make any difference to the outlook and style of the company’s Australian newspapers or its Sky News pay TV channel. James has been on the outer at the top of the Murdoch organisation since its UK subsidiary, News International, was disgraced in 2011 over the hacking of people’s phones. James was executive chairman of News International at the time. The scandal not only caused Rupert Murdoch serious reputational damage, but it sank his bid to get total control of Britain’s satellite broadcaster, BSkyB. The parliamentary inquiry into the hacking found him not fit to run a major international company. The fallout marked the end of James’s rise at News. When, in 2007, he had been made chairman of BSkyB, executive chairman of News International, and chief executive of all News Corp operations across Europe and Asia, it seemed he was being groomed to succeed Rupert. But by the middle of 2012 it had all come crashing down. He resigned his jobs at BSkyB and News International, and was recalled to corporate headquarters in New York, retaining his position as CEO for Europe and Asia. Two years later, the elder son, Lachlan, was appointed to sit at the right hand of the father as non-executive co-chairman of News Corp and 21st Century Fox Inc. As early as 1998, Murdoch had announced him as the heir-apparent but in 2005 Lachlan had quit, only to now return in triumph over his younger brother. James found himself in the humiliating position of co-chief operating officer of 21st Century Fox, reporting to Fox chief operating officer Chase Carey. The one major issue on which James publicly differentiated himself from Rupert and Lachlan was climate change Through all these comings and goings of the boys, News Corp’s Australian media outlets carried on their strident climate-change denialism, their barracking for the conservative side of politics, their crude populism and their culture wars, in particular over Australian history. Sky After Dark has become Fox News lite. That tells us that whatever titles and positions are bandied about, Rupert remains in charge. During his career at News Corp, the one major issue on which James publicly differentiated himself from Rupert and Lachlan was climate change. In 2006, a year after the Kyoto protocol took effect, Rupert announced that James had persuaded him that anthropogenic climate change was real. In Australia, this played out at the 2007 federal election in a shift of support to Labor by some of the News Corp media, notably the Australian, Sydney’s Daily Telegraph and the Brisbane Courier-Mail. Labor, under the leadership of Kevin Rudd, campaigned strongly on the need for action on climate change, while the Liberal-National coalition under John Howard equivocated. This shift in editorial outlook did not last long. After the implosion of the Labor government, News Corp threw its weight exuberantly behind Tony Abbott, the man who said climate change science was “crap”. Aside from climate change, James’s public record shows him to share important aspects of his father’s and brother’s worldview. In 2009, he gave the James MacTaggart memorial lecture at the Edinburgh television festival, which commemorates the Scottish writer-director who died in 1974. In it he assailed the BBC in terms similar to those with which the Murdoch media in Australia assails the ABC: that it is a state broadcaster – as opposed to a public broadcaster; that it crowds out commercial media; that it is something public money should not be wasted on, and that it is a mouthpiece of the left. He also argued for a very materialistic concept of press freedom: that the only guarantor of press freedom was profit. This is a perversion of fundamental media ethics. While financial independence is certainly a necessary condition for press freedom, it is only half the story. CP Scott, as editor-proprietor of the [Manchester] Guardian, put the true position best. A newspaper has “a moral as well as a material existence”. It must make enough money to be independent, but it must also recognise it has a civic duty to provide society with reliable and impartial news. The James Murdoch view implies that the freedom guaranteed by profit belongs to the profiteer. News Corporation operates on that principle. Freedom of the Murdoch press is the freedom to publish what the proprietor agrees with. For proof, ask some of Rupert’s former editors: Harold Evans (the Times), Kelvin MacKenzie (the Sun), Bruce Guthrie (the Herald Sun). James might be gone, but the family philosophy lives on. • Dr Denis Muller is a senior research fellow at the Centre for Advancing journalism, University of Melbourne"
"Cardinal's barrister Robert Richter on the trials of George Pell  


  I believe Pell's a good man ","In February 2020, I took the elevator to the fourth floor of a building in the heart of Melbourne’s courts district to interview Robert Richter, the defence barrister who represented George Pell at trial. He led me into his chambers, a room brimming with artwork, papers, books and vintage furniture. By the door was a 255-year-old leather chair made for Dr Samuel Johnson, who wrote the famous eponymous English dictionary. The relic has sentimental meaning for Richter, who taught himself English after moving with his family to Australia as a 13-year-old boy via Israel and the Soviet Union, where he was born. I put in interview requests with the prosecution, including Mark Gibson, the county court’s chief justice, Peter Kidd, and Bret Walker SC, but Richter was the only one to eventually agree to be interviewed on the record about the case. While I was writing this book, many people I spoke to – including police officers, child-abuse researchers, lawyers and senior figures in Melbourne law – spoke of their respect and admiration for Richter. Some described him as kind; most described him as brilliant. However, none would go on the record, so poor are the optics of speaking favourably of someone representing an accused child-sex offender as high-profile as Pell. I sat on a couch opposite Richter’s desk. Richter, contrary to the barrister’s black gown I’d become accustomed to seeing him in, was wearing a brown leather jacket. He leaned back into his leather office chair, sucked on his vape and told me that the reason Pell was convicted was “three years of royal commission shit”. “Shit about how he moved people around, and about how he turned up to court as a character witness when [the paedophile Gerald] Ridsdale was pleading guilty, when in reality, Pell just accompanied him to court.” Pell’s appearance before the royal commission had damaged his reputation and influenced people’s perceptions of him, Richter said. While the royal commission’s findings regarding Pell had not been made public at the time of our interview, the media coverage of Pell’s evidence, in which he “came across as wooden and doctrinaire”, had turned the public against him, Richter said. “There was three years of press that painted him as a monster.” I asked Richter about the years of positive press that Pell received, including in the aftermath of the verdict. High-profile defenders of Pell wrote column after column defending him, despite never having spent a day in the court or having had time to access transcripts. Conservative news programs did the same. Wasn’t it disingenuous to suggest that the press influenced people against Pell, when reporters were merely reporting what he said at the royal commission, and when so many powerful media personalities defended him? The difference, Richter said, was that those defending Pell got it right. He said that while he personally abhorred the politics of some of Pell’s defenders, they were correct in their assessment that the offending was impossible. Pell, just a few years senior to Richter, was “quite delightful”, Richter said. The two had become friends, despite their stark differences in world views. It may seem that Richter, an atheist opposed to drug-prohibition laws and an advocate for civil liberties and human rights, would have little in common with Pell, an orthodox Catholic opposed to the rights of LGBTIQ couples to marry, an anti-abortionist and a defender of traditional values. In fact, Richter said that one of the reasons he pursued criminal defence after a short stint working in prosecutions was because he knew he could never feel comfortable prosecuting offences such as drug crimes and petty matters. “I would never prosecute drug cases. There are cases I wouldn’t prosecute on a matter of principle, and if someone insisted I had to, my heart wouldn’t be in it. I had no objection to prosecuting things, except in cases when the law was a piece of shit.” Though Pell’s and Richter’s views differed, it was a meeting of two minds, Richter said, and he enjoyed their conversations and Pell’s sense of humour. “I always thought he was very well read. I mean, he’s got a PhD [in church history], for God’s sake. I believe Pell’s a good man. He’s very ambitious, and I think his ambition consumed him in the sense he saw things he wanted to do and had to do theologically, and pursued them rigorously.” Richter said he never believed at any point that Pell was guilty of the allegations. So, when he was convicted, Richter felt “shattered”, especially because he had believed the case would never make it past the committal hearing. “I lost my cool after the conviction. I thought it was a perverse verdict.” Richter fell into a depression. He began to withdraw. “It was horrible. It was different in this instance, as we had the first trial, which I thought we won hands down. The jury disagreed. So I thought, the second time around, the worst-case scenario would be another hung jury. “So the conviction came to me as a complete shock. I felt neutered.” Did he think the outcome might have been different if he had put Pell on the witness stand to face examination and cross-examination? “I doubt it. Look, the assessment that we made – and we made it collectively with Pell – was there was no point in calling him to give evidence. He’d given an explanation on tape, a voluntary one. He gave his account to the detectives. And how does he prove a negative? Other than by saying, ‘I didn’t do it. It wasn’t me’? What else could he say if he was giving evidence? There was no point. To call someone against whom the evidence was as it was, to call them is almost to invite a jury to ask, ‘Who do you believe? The man who says “I didn’t do it”, or the man who says the opposite?’” That was the wrong question for the jurors to be focused on, Richter said. “We didn’t need to prove it was impossible for the offending to occur. We just needed to prove there was a reasonable doubt as to whether it happened, and that’s what we needed the jury to focus on.” Richter, who shows little sign of stopping at the age of 74, despite his family imploring him to slow down, said that after the verdict, “I was going to give it all away”. One of his colleagues and oldest friends calls Richter “snakeskin” – because when he is under stress, the skin begins to peel off his face. He also fell into a deep depression. His stress and anxiety once again reared up. These are conditions that Richter does not shy away from disclosing when asked. “I seriously thought: I don’t think I can take this,” he recalls. After Pell’s sentencing, Richter tried to take a step back from work, contemplating whether it was all worth it after almost five decades. “I thought about it for weeks. I tried not to work. And then, as time went on, I thought, ‘No, I’m not giving up. I have certain abilities and skills I don’t think should go to waste. I’m not ready to retire.’ There are certain cases that come up, and I thought if I could do anything to help, I should. When I run out of energy I want to reduce the workload and start advising more, on tactics and things of that nature. But, at the moment, I’m in full fighting mode. At my age, I can no longer work 48 hours nonstop, but I can still work until two or three in the morning.” While Walker led the appeal, Richter focused on recovering, and then on offering his services pro bono to other cases. He also took on some smaller sexual assault trials, securing acquittals for his clients in each one. It restored his confidence. “And that made me think: I just don’t know what to think about the jury in the Pell case,” he said. “As a barrister, I have to accept that juries get things right, by and large. But there’s a moral panic when it comes to sexual abuse that requires people to assume that because someone claims to be a victim you treat them as a victim, as though that’s all that’s required as proof to begin with.” When the court of appeal upheld the verdict, it was another blow to Richter, but when I interviewed him he felt resigned about letting the process play out, and he seemed hopeful. “I also have to accept, as does the high court, that every now and again the jury will get something wrong, and they’ll get it wrong in a way that results in a court quashing a conviction. I’ve committed too much time and effort to this one to allow myself to think at this stage we will lose.” Asked if he would run the trial differently if he could do it all again, Richter said vehemently: “No.” On 7 April this year George Pell was freed from jail immediately after the high court’s decision that his appeal should be upheld, as there was “a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted”.

  Last lockdown I tore into working and full-time parenting with gusto. This time, I am so tired ","“Why are you crying mummy?” “Oh baby, I’m not crying,” I sobbed. “Well, OK, I am crying,” I conceded, “but I’m happy-crying because the man on the TV said something funny.” “Oh! Ahahahahahahahahaha!” giggled my four-year-old, because when someone says something funny, it’s just good manners to laugh, even if they’re on the TV and they can’t hear you. Well, that of course set the 10-month old off, because if her brother laughs, she has to laugh too, and there she sat, giggling away and giving Victorian premier Daniel Andrews a rousing round of applause. Everyone these days gets a rousing round of applause, because she’s just learned to clap. After the daily press conference and announcement of stage four restrictions in Melbourne, we set off on our daily two-hour walk around the streets of St Kilda. It’s no lie that grief comes in waves, a somewhat ironic realisation to have as I walked along the foreshore watching the sun set over the ocean. Every question I asked myself felt like another of those rolling, dark waves. How will I help Mr Four burn off energy when we can only spend one hour exercising? How will we walk the dog if we can only do it before 8pm when the kids are awake? How can I go without daycare for six weeks if I need to work? What will happen to the workers at daycare if services are shut down? Who do I need to check in on? Who do I need to drop food or meals to? How many more important work calls realistically can be interrupted by a kid screaming for a snack (“Mum I’m starving”) or a nappy change (“Mum the baby’s bum smells bad!”)? Parenting is (mostly) a joy, but the responsibility of caring for another human and the unreasonable expectations that come with that responsibility, both from within and outside, lead to a one-way ticket to guiltsville. But lockdown guilt is a different category altogether. Like comparing a paddle at the beach to big-wave surfing, where the minimum height of a breaker is 20 feet and surfers teeter on the edge, threatening to be overwhelmed at any minute with this huge force of nature looming behind them. Last lockdown I tore into working and full-time parenting with gusto. I printed off all the activity sheets, I signed the kids up to online music classes, went to the $2 shop and bought up bags of art supplies, organised treasure hunts, set up obstacle courses, made all the baked goods, went for two-hour walks and even did a blog post to help other parents with activity ideas. Coming into stage four, I’m so tired. Working, parenting, keeping the house going. The only time I get to myself is when the kids are asleep, so I have to make the most of it. Making sure my work gets done, cleaning up, catching up on emails, doing the food shopping online, checking in on friends who live alone, checking in on family, watching a snippet of TV so I can escape for a spell. But that leaves me with just four or five hours of sleep, so I wake up exhausted, not quite ready to do it all again. I tell all my parent friends not to have unrealistic expectations. “Don’t even worry about screen time! Give yourself a break and do whatever you need to do to get by!” After all this is temporary, right? But I’m a dirty, rotten hypocrite, because every time I put my son in front of a screen so I can take a work call – or breastfeed his sister to sleep, have a conversation that doesn’t involve Pokemon, empty the dishwasher, do the laundry, put in the online order for our shopping so I can collect it as quickly as possible – the guilt ties itself around my heart like a tourniquet. When your kids are as young as ours they can’t be left unattended, even for a minute of the day. Combine that with trying to work, and by the end of the day you’re depleted in every way – mental, physically and emotionally. After the stage four announcement I went online and ordered as much outdoor play equipment as we could reasonably afford. We have a small backyard, which is a privilege, and we’ll need to make the most of what we’ve got. Then I felt guilty for the parents who have no backyard or the money to buy extra toys for their kids. For the parents with children with special needs. For parents who are trying to homeschool and work. For the parents whose bosses aren’t as sympathetic or as flexible as mine. For parents whose partners don’t pitch in the way mine does. For the parents who don’t have a partner. For all the people doing it tough who aren’t parents. For anyone who’s lost their job. The list goes on. I also battle with how much to tell my kids, how honest to be and how much to protect them, as is my instinct. Last week I interviewed Uncle Bruce Pascoe about his new children’s book Found. It’s about a calf that loses its family when the other cows are taken away. He is left all alone. Many parallels have been drawn between the story of Found and the stolen generations and I asked Uncle Bruce at what age we should start truth-telling. A former schoolteacher, he told me, “Lay it all out there, I never talk down to kids. They’re rugged little individuals and they do get upset by the inequities and misfortune of the world. But I think it’s possible to talk to them about it. And I don’t think you destroy their hopes, or their happiness, by talking about the realities of the world. It’s the way you talk about it. That is important.” Or as we say in our house, “kids bounce”. My son’s fourth birthday was squeezed in before the first lockdown in March. But his sister is unlikely to be as lucky. After a very long and bumpy road to welcome her into this world, I’m preparing myself mentally to cancel her first birthday party, slated for September. She won’t remember. But I will."
Pixel 4a review  The best phone Google has made in years ,"The Pixel 4a is a return to form for Google’s smartphone efforts: a lower-cost, mid-range phone that is high quality, long-lasting and fairly small, with a great camera. The £349 Pixel 4a is very much an attempt to boil down a smartphone to only the essentials and then make them all work really well.  It slots under the higher-priced £669-and-up Pixel 4 series, replacing last year’s Pixel 3a and 3a XL with only one size of phone, taking the design of the 3a and expanding the screen to fill the front of the device. A 5G version is coming later in the year but for now the Pixel 4a is 4G only. The body is high-quality, soft-touch polycarbonate and feels surprisingly nice. The 5.8in FHD+ OLED screen looks great: it is bright, crisp enough and has reasonably slim bezels all the way around. There is a fairly large hole in the top left of the screen for the selfie camera and the display does not have the 90Hz refresh rate of some slightly more expensive competitors but it does have HDR certification for watching movies. The Pixel 4a has a 4.5% bigger screen than its predecessor but its body is 5.8% smaller overall. At only 144mm in length, 69.4mm in width, 8.8mm in thickness and weighing 143g, the Pixel 4a is one of the smallest phones you can buy in 2020. It feels really great in the hand. It may disappoint super-phone aficionados but for those longing for a big-enough screen in a small and light device that doesn’t break the bank, the Pixel 4a is a breath of fresh air. The back of the device has a traditional fingerprint scanner that just works, and does so in all apps. Google’s face unlock on the Pixel 4 worked brilliantly for unlocking the phone but even nine months later, only a handful of third-party apps support it. The top features the lesser-spotted headphone socket. The bottom a universal USB-C socket for power. The phone has stereo speakers that are very good. There’s no wireless charging, nor official water-resistance rating. Google has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic to a greater extent than other smartphone companies, which has delayed the release of the Pixel 4a by several months and means there is a long lead time between its announcement and open sale in October. It also means the phone will only available in black to start with. Screen: 5.8in FHD+ OLED (443ppi) Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 128GB Operating system: Android 10 Camera: 12.2MP rear, 8MP selfie-camera Connectivity: LTE, eSIM, wifi 5, NFC, Bluetooth 5.1, headphones and GPS Dimensions: 144 x 69.4 x 8.2mm Weight: 143g The Pixel 4a uses the upper-middle range Snapdragon 730G chip from Qualcomm, which is one of the last remaining new processors not to feature 5G and a significant step up from Snapdragon 670 used in the Pixel 3a last year. It comes in a single version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Day-to-day performance was really good, matching the sort of smooth operation you would expect of top-spec phones from the last few years. Switching between apps, loading images, unlocking the phone and other bits was snappy; even games such as Real Racing 3 performed well. Battery life was also good for a relatively small and light phone. The Pixel 4a lasts 31 hours between charges, which is significantly longer than the larger Pixel 3a XL and iPhone SE (both 27 hours), consistently going from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two. That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the always-on display active, the screen on for up to five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, browsing and using apps, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos. Turning off the always-on display added about two hours of battery life. The Pixel 4a ships with an 18W fast charger that takes 90 minutes to fully charge the phone, hitting 50% in half an hour. Google does not provide an estimate for the expected number of full charge cycles from the Pixel 4a batteries. However, the typical lifespan of a smartphone battery is at least 500 cycles while maintaining at least 80% capacity. The Pixel 4a is generally repairable. Out of warranty repairs cost £110 for the screen or £60 for the battery through one of Google’s repair partners iSmash or via the Google Store. The Pixel 4a contains about 45% of post-consumer recycled material in its plastic mechanical parts, part of Google’s commitment to include recycled materials in all its products launching from 2022. The company publishes environmental impact reports for some of its products. Google will recycle all Pixel devices free of charge. The Pixel 4a ships with Google’s version of Android 10 and buyers can expect a minimum of three years of operating system and security updates, which is good for a phone of this price but is still some way behind Apple’s five-year support for iPhones (including the £419 iPhone SE). The Pixel’s version of Android is slick and well-optimised, here matching that running on the Pixel 4 series from October last year. Generally speaking, it is attractive and simple, and works like most other versions of Android, with full adoption of the gesture controls, theme support and other additions made to standard Android 10. But on top are a few Google-exclusives, first introduced with the Pixel 4, that revolve around using artificial intelligence run locally on the phone, rather than on a remote Google server as used to be required. The new Google Assistant experience is most noticeable. It uses an advanced local voice-recognition system to dramatically accelerate the whole experience, allowing Assistant to understand and respond immediately, with no lag at all. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speed, from launching apps, finding things and performing tasks. It’s a night and day improvement and is better at preserving your privacy as the process is done locally, on your device. The Pixel 4a also has Google’s Now Playing system that recognises songs playing around you, and the impressive Google Recorder app that can transcribe speech in real time. The Live Caption system that transcribes videos in real time using on-device AI can now be used for voice and video calls, too. The Pixel 4a has Google’s excellent single-camera system. It lacks the second camera for optical zoom from the Pixel 4 but keeps most of its software features including Google’s industry-leading Night Sight for super low-light photography, an astrophotography mode to shoot the stars, live HDR+ allowing you to tweak the light and dark areas in real time, plus portrait mode for people and pets. It is arguably the best point-and-shoot camera you can get for under £600, producing crisp, well-balanced and highly detailed shots in most environments. But the Pixel 4a isn’t quite as versatile as some rivals of a similar price that come equipped with ultra-wide and zoom cameras as well. Video captured at up to 4K at 30 frames per second is pretty good for the price, too, although I often accidentally blocked the mic with my hand. The selfie camera is very good, capturing good images in most lighting conditions, but it struggles a little with fine detail when expanded to full-size. The phone has really powerful and good vibration for alerts and haptics. There is no way to schedule the always-on display to turn on or off, such as at night. The Pixel 4a costs £349 and is only available in black to start with. For comparison, the Pixel 4 has an RRP of £669, the OnePlus Nord costs £379 and the iPhone SE costs £419. It will be available to pre-order from 10 September and go on sale on 1 October. The Pixel 4a is Google’s best smartphone in years. It is small, light and feels great. It has an OLED screen that is colourful, crisp and big enough for most things. Performance is good, the battery lasts a solid 31 hours between charges and the camera is leagues better than the price may suggest. It even has a headphone socket, with is a true rarity in 2020. You get monthly security updates, at least three years of software updates and Google-exclusive features, some of which are genuinely impressive. The speed of the new Google Assistant is a game-changer but whether you actually want to routinely talk to your phone is another matter. It’s not perfect, of course. There is no 5G on offer (yet). The body is plastic and doesn’t feel as premium as metal and glass competitors, and there’s no water-resistance rating. The mid-range smartphone market is increasingly competitive, too, meaning the Pixel 4a faces stiff competition from some household names, including Apple’s £419 iPhone SE and the new OnePlus Nord, which has 5G, more cameras and a bigger, better screen for £30 more. But at £349 for a smaller, lighter phone that works really, really well from the actual maker of Android, the Google Pixel 4a is simply great. Pros: great camera, good screen, good software and update support, good battery life, headphone socket, relatively small, fairly inexpensive Cons: no 5G, only single camera, no wireless charging, no water resistance, no expandable storage Google Pixel 4 review: a good phone ruined by poor battery life Google Pixel 4 XL review: not quite ready for primetime Pixel 3a review: the people’s Google phone? Pixel 3a XL review: the cheaper Google phone to buy OnePlus Nord review: top-quality phone is true bargain at £379 iPhone SE review: Apple’s cut-price smartphone king Fairphone 3 review: the most ethical and repairable phone you can buy

"'I get censored four or five times a year'  Paul McCarthy, art's virtuoso of vile ","Paul McCarthy’s vision of modern America is relentlessly revolting. His art depicts his nation as a crumbling edifice of pop culture, creeping fascism and depraved, uninhibited capitalism. “It’s always been this thing of looking at the underbelly of western culture, and the horror of its results,” he says over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. “It’s a questioning of our condition, our way of life. Look at America right now with its racism and its violence, and yet we have Disneyland.” His art, he says, is “trying to expose that – the posing of the purity and the innocence”. How much more absurd can you get than Trump? It’s a performance, it's theatre Some of this work has been on a grand scale. In 2013, for the work Rebel Dabble Babble, McCarthy built two derelict houses in a dark, grim New York warehouse. Each one was filled with screens showing James Dean and the cast of Rebel Without a Cause engaged in brutal, close-up, hardcore pornography. A man in a long coat followed me around the show on my visit – the stereotypical flashing pervert, hands stuffed into his pockets, sweating and mumbling to himself. It wasn’t clear if he was part of the show or just a very excited gallerygoer, but it all contributed to the exhibition’s visceral unease. It was quintessential McCarthy. Now, the 74-year-old is returning to Switzerland – the country where 12 years ago he caused a sensation by exhibiting a giant inflatable turd that came untethered, brought down a power line and landed in the playground of a children’s home – for an exhibition of works from throughout his career titled Alpine Stories and Other Dystopias. He was born more than 5,000 miles away, in Salt Lake City, but Switzerland has been a lifelong obsession. “At quite an early age I was interested in mountaineering,” he says. “I think it had a lot to do with wanting to leave where I was. When I was in high school, I wanted to be a Swiss mountain guide, which was a pretty rare choice of occupation in Utah. It was about bohemian lifestyles, about somehow leaving these conventions of normality.” But McCarthy didn’t simply leave those conventions, he dedicated his life to exposing their decrepitude. If Switzerland represents a faraway ideal for American dreamers, McCarthy’s remake of the Alpine-themed Shirley Temple movie Heidi (created with with fellow artist Mike Kelley in 1992) set out to mock and denigrate Hollywood’s vision of a beautiful European escape. “The other subject that began to come up at that time for me was fascism. So this combination of the Alps, lederhosen, father figures, the Matterhorn, the Disneyland aesthetic, fascism and America all becomes a big stew.” A stew where the idealism of America and Hollywood is boiled until evil rises like scum to the surface. Due to problems with shipping art during the pandemic, the Swiss exhibition at Tarmak 22 in Gstaad features no new work, only pieces that were already in storage in Switzerland when coronavirus hit. “It’s a kind of smorgasbord,” McCarthy says. Now an art world that McCarthy says is usually “moving like a steam shovel” has been stilled, the pandemic has offered a rare chance to look back over older work. “Meanings change, you see things differently, you see connections, threads that weave through things.” The threads of violence and fascism, and the constant questioning of the state of things, appear again and again in his work, each new decade bringing fresh and relevant perspectives on old tropes. McCarthy left Utah in the early 70s to study fine art in California. Ever since, his complex and often utterly gross art has been headline-grabbing stuff. There was that rampant inflatable turd (Complex Shit, 2008) in Switzerland, his enormous buttplug balloon (Tree, 2014) in Paris, which was deflated by a protester; he’s created animatronic rubber sculptures of George W Bush having sex with a pig, and drawings of Snow White and her seven dwarves defecating on each other. These days McCarthy is a well-respected art-world figure, with big museum shows and a major gallery representing him. But it took him a while to get there. He didn’t even sell any art until the early 90s. Before then, he’d been busy making a name for himself as the leading light of ultra-challenging American performance art, armed only with vomit, ketchup, masks and nudity – as in his 1976 film Rocky, which was on display in the early days of Tate Modern. It showed McCarthy dressed as the boxer, punching himself repeatedly in the head, pouring ketchup over his genitals, masturbating and muttering to himself. It’s relentless, violent, traumatic. When asked if America still needs exposing in 2020, a time when the country’s nastier sides are more apparent than ever, McCarthy’s tone switches from considered drawl to something closer to what you’d expect from a man who made a career out of rubbing ketchup into his orifices. “How much more absurd can you get than Donald Trump? It’s a really good example of a performance, it’s theatre. He’s really just manipulating a population. The idea that we could go, ‘Hey, we don’t need this any more, let’s just make images of utopia, of where we want to go …’” His voice trails off. He considers the idea silently for a minute, then his thoughts bubble over. “That’s your head in the sand. Maybe I don’t have a choice but to throw up. We’re still trying to figure out what the fuck’s going on. Even now. Like, what is going on? We’re so utterly fucked up that, if anything, we really do need these experiments into this reality.” He’s not sure if he’s going to make work about Trump yet, but you wouldn’t be surprised if he did. That’s the point of McCarthy’s art, be it film, sculpture, drawing, installation: to figure what is going on around you. There are no conclusions, no hard facts, just questions and experiments. But to do it the way McCarthy has always done it – with sex, violence, bodily fluids and sick humour – is a tricky thing in 2020. Does he ever worry about “cancel culture”, the threat of an online backlash? “When you refer to cancel culture, I don’t really know what that means any more,” he says with the weariness of a man who has spent his adult life being told he can’t make the art he’s trying to make. “But in the past few years I’ve been stopped a number of times, censored. I don’t know, four, five times a year.” He won’t be drawn on specific instances. That censorship may have increased as the world has grown more conservative, but it’s something he’s always taken in his stride. “I’ve always had this view that making risky art was just really risky. You don’t know what it’s saying, it sits on an edge. At times I’ve made work where I’ve gone, ‘What the hell, are you really sure that’s what you want to do?’”  Few artists today do performances as in-your-face as his 70s works such as Class Fool, where he stuffed a Barbie doll up his backside and vomited over a ketchup-covered classroom. Few artists today are making installations as shocking or ambitious as Rebel Dabble Babble. It’s a testament to how hard he pushes things that, 40 years into his career, he’s still one of the most confrontational, shocking and jaw-droppingly weird artists you’ll encounter. The most striking thing of all is that his disgusting visions of modern life don’t seem all that far removed from reality. Whereas once you could look at what he did as extreme, now, the more you take in his violence and anger, the more you realise that the world has slowly transformed into a big Paul McCarthy artwork. It’s the greatest Hollywood twist of all: here you are, wading through the faeces thinking it’s just a nightmare, but actually you were awake the whole time. “We’re really in a much more confused state than we’ve ever been,” he says. It’s not McCarthy who’s weird and gross, it’s the world itself. Real life has just finally caught up with him – and that should seriously worry us all. • Paul McCarthy’s exhibition, Alpine Stories and Other Dystopias, is at Tarmak 22, Gstaad, until 15 August.

  Women’s sport faces broadcast barrier as small issues add up to significant problems ","With the NSW Swifts leading the Giants by just two goals with 13 minutes remaining in the match, Sunday’s Super Netball coverage was abruptly cut. The game was replaced by Victorian premier Daniel Andrews’ press conference declaring a state of disaster. Clearly, no one can be critical of the decision to leave a sporting event to provide a vital update on the biggest crisis facing Australia, and particularly Victoria, since the second world war, but it was the subsequent decisions made by the broadcaster that raise questions.  Channel Nine’s broadcast of Andrews’ press conference was ended at 3pm in NSW and Queensland to begin pre-game coverage of an NRL match between Melbourne and Newcastle. Coverage of the Super Netball game never returned and no final scores were provided. With the rugby league scheduled to kick off at 4:05pm, the urgency to begin the buildup was somewhat misplaced. With both sports falling under the Wide World of Sports umbrella, it seems unusual that consideration could not have been given to provide a wrap-up of the netball during the NRL’s hour-long pre-game coverage. While the rest of the Super Netball game was eventually made available on the 9Now platform, a simple acknowledgement from the NRL presenters, along with some quick highlights, the announcement of the final score and player of the match, would have gone a long way to appeasing those watching on Channel Nine – and to demonstrating its commitment to the sport. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, NSW Swifts player and England international Helen Housby acknowledged the crucial importance of the Covid updates but also suggested there were “double standards” in the way female athletes are treated and portrayed in the media. “The things that are made possible for the other codes probably aren’t the same for netball,” she said. Defenders of the broadcaster could possibly cite the higher ratings the NRL receives, but along with the money spent by Nine to secure the rights, the issue facing netball – and other women’s sports – is that small decisions like this demonstrate the priorities of broadcasters and media outlets. It all adds up and can act as a barrier to broadening the audience. The Australian government has recognised the significant hurdles women’s sports face to gain the kind of coverage that the major men’s sports take for granted and since 2017 it has given Foxtel a total of $40m to boost coverage of women’s sport. Putting aside the question of why a pay-TV platform deserves that kind of federal investment ahead of free-to-air broadcasters, for many women’s sports, it is not the ideal platform. Growth sports like netball are aiming to get their product into as many households as possible, meaning a subscription service such as Foxtel cannot offer the audience they need. And even for those women’s sports that do receive coverage from Foxtel, the impacts appear minimal. Analysis done by women in sport collective Siren Sport revealed that in the seven days to Monday 3 August, 7.5 of the 1,344 broadcast hours across Foxtel’s eight sports channels showed women’s sport, representing 0.56% of their sporting coverage for the period. Siren and Swinburne University also analysed the coverage of women’s sport on the Fox Sports website between April and June 2020 and found that only 2.37% of stories on the homepage covered women’s sport. Super Netball’s deal with Nine was seen as ground-breaking when it was announced in late 2016, but problems have persisted throughout the first four years of the competition. From games being pushed to the minor channels, to consistent scheduling of matches while most netball fans are out playing the game themselves, Nine has not provided the guaranteed visibility the sport would have hoped for. In addition to the lack of consideration afforded netball on Sunday, the fixtures released on Tuesday for the second and third rounds of the competition reveal Nine will not broadcast any round three matches. These will instead be relegated to Telstra’s Netball Live app, apparently due to the condensed nature of the season, with round three scheduled to take place on a Tuesday and Wednesday. However with Super Netball entering the fifth and final year of its deal with Nine in 2021, each of these small problems becomes more significant and the challenge of growing the audience harder. Netball players and fans are told to be grateful the sport receives coverage at all, but the implications are adding up and Super Netball faces a tough road ahead to improve its position in sport’s pecking order."

  World Rugby emerges as kingmaker in trans-Tasman rugby standoff ","With Australia and New Zealand at loggerheads over the composition of a future trans-Tasman competition, World Rugby may yet play a key role in determining the size and shape of any Anzac tournament. It went almost unnoticed in Australia, but World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont has publicly supported New Zealand’s plan to create an eight to 10 team competition including the five Kiwi Super Rugby franchises and a “leaner” Australian contingent, something administrators on this side of the Tasman vigorously oppose. Beaumont also revealed World Rugby was open to funding a Pacific Islands team in the proposed trans-Tasman competition, which would give the Kiwis six of the minimum eight sides they were seeking to take part. It is not World Rugby’s authority, power or prestige that might influence the outcome of the trans-Tasman negotiations, rescheduled for this week, but money. Australian administrators would no doubt like to tell Beaumont to mind his own business, but World Rugby has emerged as the lender of last resort for national unions who find themselves in financial trouble as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. World Rugby has already advanced Rugby Australia about $14m, which will help the cash-strapped national union to remain solvent for the rest of the year. But what happens after that? Significantly, Australian rugby does not have a broadcast agreement for next year and beyond. The current interim deal with Fox Sports, reportedly worth about $8m to $10m, will run out at the end of the year. RA cannot negotiate a new broadcast deal with Fox Sports, or anyone else, until it finalises a Super Rugby competition format for next year. Australia has threatened to go it alone if New Zealand stands firm on only two or three Australian teams participating in the proposed trans-Tasman competition, but a five-team Australian competition would be commercially challenging. Veteran Wallabies second-rower Rob Simmons is the latest player to announce he is heading overseas at the end of the year and in the absence of a lucrative broadcast deal many more are expected to follow. RA will need to find a significant amount of money to ensure required Wallabies remain in Australia. Perhaps this explains, in part, why RA has engaged a “restructuring expert” to cut a further $15m from the organisation. This follows RA reducing its staff by a third in an earlier restructure forced by Covid-19, which saved $5.5m. Of course, the simplest way to save $15m would be to cut two Australian Super Rugby franchises, but that is not something RA is considering at the moment. When New Zealand indicated it only wanted two or three Australian teams to participate in a trans-Tasman competition it put RA in an awkward political position. After axing the Western Force in acrimonious circumstances in 2017 RA understandably does not want to go through the agony again, while the emergence of mining magnate Andrew “Twiggy” Forrest as a benefactor of the Perth-based side has created a new dynamic in Australian rugby. But there is possibly a more practical reason for RA standing firm on five Australian teams playing in a trans-Tasman competition, at least until it becomes certain that the tournament will actually go ahead next year. With Victoria declared a “state of disaster” as a result of a second wave of Covid-19, New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern indicated the creation of a trans-Tasman travel bubble may be some time away, which could have implications for a trans-Tasman rugby competition – and Bledisloe Cup series – if the virus is not contained. If Australia was forced to go it alone, as it has threatened to do if the Kiwis refuse to relent on the number of teams, it would need all five Australian Super Rugby franchises to play in a domestic competition next year. Signalling an intention to axe two Australian franchises now would result in an exodus of players to overseas clubs and remaining Super Rugby teams, which would make it difficult to get the culled sides up and running again for a domestic competition if required. RA’s plan appears to be to call New Zealand’s bluff, but if that does not work, some difficult decisions will need to be made and they will need to be made in the best interests of Australian rugby as a whole, not just individual teams. There has been a lot of “talking up” of the Super Rugby AU competition in recent weeks by local pundits. Even new Wallabies coach Dave Rennie praised the “genuine intensity” of the Brumbies’ 22-20 win against the Queensland Reds in Canberra last Saturday night. While the Brumbies-Reds match, and indeed the Melbourne Rebels-Force game at Leichhardt Oval last Friday, were spirited contests, anyone who thinks they were close to the standard of Super Rugby Aotearoa can think again. At some point RA may need to seek another hand-out from World Rugby, which may or may not feel as generous next time if Australia turns its back on a trans-Tasman concept that its chairman is backing."
Cricket  Australia postpones T20 series with West Indies as England tour looms large ,"Cricket Australia has postponed a home Twenty20 series against West Indies as it moves closer to getting the green light for next month’s limited-overs tour of England. Australia were slated to play West Indies in matches on 4, 6 and 9 October as part of their preparation for the T20 World Cup. The postponement of that has prompted the international schedule to be overhauled with the most notable change being that the Indian Premier League, which will now run from 19 September until 10 November in the UAE. CA and the West Indies Cricket Board have agreed to delay this year’s T20 series, wanting it to coincide with the rescheduled T20 World Cup in Australia either in 2021 or 2022. The Australians are still scheduled to face India in a T20 series from 11 to 17 October, but that series will also have to be shifted given it now falls in the middle of the IPL. Justin Langer’s team has not taken the field since the trans-Tasman ODI at the SCG on 13 March. The team and support staff are expected to board a charter flight later this month and start a tour of England on 4 September, playing three T20s and three ODIs. They will follow the same biosecurity protocols used throughout the recent England-West Indies series. CA has been locked in discussions with all levels of government in Australia since the outset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The governing body, which has already named a 26-man squad for the proposed series in England, wants state-government exemptions to be ticked off before signing off on the UK tour. The most important issue relates to the two-week quarantine period that players must serve upon returning to Australia, either via the IPL or after the one-day tour. Players will isolate in a hotel and follow standard protocols but CA is desperate for them to be given special permission to train. Being stuck in a room for a fortnight will be particularly challenging for Pat Cummins and his fellow quicks, who risk breaking down if they do not build up bowling workloads before the Test series against India. The other notable exemption relates to outbound interstate travel. CA is hoping the entire touring party will be allowed to fly from their respective home cities then catch the international flight on the same date. Finch and star allrounder Glenn Maxwell are both based in Victoria, which has been brought to a halt by the health crisis and is the subject of border closures across the country."

  Bolt's talent for speed becomes more apparent now it is denied to us ","Something you may not know about me: there is almost no set of circumstances – personal, professional, medical – in which I will not drop everything to watch Usain Bolt. Naturally, my personalised YouTube algorithm has already known this for some time, and will now instantly recommend me a selection of his greatest hits whenever I log in. “Usain Bolt | IAAF Daegu 2011 (200m s/f)”: yes please! “Bolt beats Gatlin | 2015 World Championships [HD]”: click! “Men’s 200m final | London 2017”: er, I think you’ll find Bolt didn’t run the 200 metres in London that year. Nice try, algorithm. Now get this grubby irrelevance out of my sight. Perhaps you have your own favourite Bolt race. Perhaps it’s the first time he truly astonished us: the 100m at the Beijing Olympics in 2008, where he smashed the world record despite basically doing jazz hands from about 70 metres, like a Victorian street magician. Perhaps it’s the 9.58sec in Berlin the following summer, a truly ridiculous effort, one best remembered for the collective and involuntary noise the crowd makes when it sees the clock: a sort of aaaawwweuuurrrrgh. This was sport as testimony: after all, you didn’t simply watch Bolt breaking a world record. You witnessed it. You shared it. You shook people by the shoulders and asked – a little superfluously – did you see that? Alternatively, perhaps you gorged yourself to nausea on sporting nostalgia during lockdown, in which case the reason for this space being occupied by Bolt this week may not be immediately clear. He has, after all, been retired almost three years: time largely spent pursuing a football career, and more recently becoming the father to a baby girl called – genuinely – Olympia Lightning. But as we make our disorienting way through what should have been an Olympic summer, we are fleetingly reminded of the vast Bolt-shaped hole in the sporting landscape: not just the man himself, but the emotions he inspired. First, there’s the speed. Or at least, the illusion of speed. For if you think about it, 27.8mph isn’t actually that fast: at least not until you conceptualise it, choreograph it, set it in context. This is why I always preferred watching Bolt over 200m: the way the straightening curve seemed to catapult him down the home straight like a slingshot, the way he would often cross the line with his rivals comically, crushingly out of the frame. But that was the greatness of Bolt: to temporarily render every single other human on earth irrelevant. Then there was the illusion of effortlessness. This is an easier one to understand: right from the start of Bolt’s career we were sold a tale of the laid-back super-freak partying his way to the start line fuelled by chicken nuggets and a winsome smile. And yet, if Bolt spent the first half of his career creating this character, he spent the second demolishing it. Pursued by injuries on one hand and the irrepressible Gatlin on the other, Bolt’s later triumphs were a testament not just to his raw speed but to his resolve: the mental fortitude to keep returning to a mountain he had climbed many times over. For all the exhaustive analysis of Bolt as a physical phenomenon – the high knees, the unorthodox stride, the asymmetrical weight distribution – perhaps we underrate him as a force of pure, competitive will. Finally the illusion of virtue, and in particular the slightly melodramatic “good v evil” narrative that attached itself to his late-career duel with Gatlin. There is, of course, nothing intrinsically moral about running fast for a prescribed distance. And yet. Given the past and present of athletics, a sport steeped in vice, apathy and misrule, in world champions being suspended for missing dope tests and 200m races accidentally being run over 185 metres, perhaps it’s little surprise that even a retired Bolt can feel like the one last pure good thing, the final bulwark against total, entropic abyss. Naturally, it’s a good deal more complicated than that. For one thing, there are plenty of people out there who will tell you with a nudge and a wink that if something looks too good to be true, eh, you know what I mean, eh? Who will show you an old, viral list of the then best 100m times in history with all the dopers scrawled out, leaving Bolt out on his own, immaculate, adrift in a sea of red ink. Often this embittered nihilism will dress itself up as some great act of selfless nobility, as if the height of moral courage is in tweeting a picture of a great athlete with the syringe emoji attached to it. And despite never having failed a test, despite not offering a shred of evidence to the contrary other than being phenomenally good, Bolt’s dominance of a historically dirty sport will continue to curse him. Set a world record and everyone hoists you on to a pedestal. Three decades later, when that record is still standing, you may find time has curiously rotted rather than ripened your achievement. What do you do with that doubt? How do you process incredulity in a sport that brutally punishes its believers? Maybe the most courageous thing to do is to keep believing. To risk looking like a sap in 20 years’ time. To embrace the possibility of your own ridicule and plant your flag in the sand nonetheless. To say yes, this sport is diseased to its bones, but I still believe in the power of shock and miracles. I still believe in athletics. I still believe in Usain Bolt."

  Football looks to digital revolution to find missing link between base and elite ","A brave new world, or financial freefall – that is the question that faces all sports as the digital revolution in broadcasting gathers pace. But while heavy hitters such as AFL and NRL have fiscal security in the shape of long-term, lucrative deals with “traditional” media to help ease the transition, for others there is a need for speed. Football, for example, has been holding very detailed discussions regarding an OTT (Over the Top) broadcasting set-up. With the clock already ticking on its one-year extension with Fox Sports, the perennial under-achiever of Australian sport is pondering the benefits of bringing its content in-house, and selling direct to the consumer. It is believed the plan is to bring the entire “football family” under one roof – including coverage of all competitions from the top down to the lower reaches of the NPL and even grassroots football, along with the registration process for the sport’s two million-strong playing base. It is a whole-of-game platform which would bring together all the sorts of content normally distributed via social channels, and – crucially – it would be monetised by those platforms, not football. It is hoped this can finally solve the conundrum of how to connect the base to the elite, for so long the game’s missing link. This is the sort of captive market that can prove attractive to advertisers, and big media investors. But as with all new ventures, there is considerable risk. Hunter Fujak, a lecturer in sports management at Deakin University, says while the idea of controlling your own content is alluring, it is vital to get the fundamentals of broadcasting right in order to achieve success. “The idea you can just record it, broadcast it, and people will show up is a bit of a mirage,” he says. “Broadcast is an outcome of a sport’s popularity, not a driver. Fundamentally, there has to be a group of people who want to watch your content.” However, he argues that of the codes outside the big two of AFL football and rugby league, football is in the best position to make a go of OTT. “Seven per cent of Australians are uniquely interested in football and no other code. That compares to only 2% with rugby union, because there is a high overlap with league. The latent group of consumers underpinning the code is stronger for football. That unique tribe is there.” But with opportunity comes a big challenge. Fujak’s PhD research (which was limited to Sydney only) showed that of all football fans, only 6% are uniquely fans of the A-League. Thirty-four per cent are interested in overseas competitions, while 60% categorise themselves as interested in both. This seems to confirm the theory that A-League ratings dropped off when Fox Sports lost the English Premier League rights to Optus – a split which forced consumers to decide where to put their money. A further problem in going down the OTT road is the cost of producing the live broadcasts on game days. In 2020, only Tennis Australia and V8 Supercars produce their own content, and there are just a handful of companies that production can be outsourced to. The alternative is purchasing your own trucks, cameras and studios, which of course is a costly business. Shane Mattiske, adviser to the sports media industry and a former acting CEO of the NRL, agrees the transition process is a tricky one. “There’s clearly a shift in the broadcast landscape, accelerated through Covid, but a better model would be to find a blend of traditional broadcast with the guaranteed rights fees, and an OTT model where you can deliver a large breadth of content – to allow passionate fans to delve deep into that pool. “The US sports like the NBA have massive fan bases that deliver a much better commercial model. In Australia, it’s smaller, and the pay-TV model works because sport is part of a bundle of other sports and entertainment offerings. So there is cross fertilisation, with an audience that is there in advance to build scale. With OTT, revenue is directly attributable to that sport.” But Mattiske also sees advantages for football. “There are two million participants and the average rego [registration] fee is around $300 – so you have got a $600m football economy just around regos. That’s massive. The sport needs to reconnect and ensure it functions and works as a holistic entity. Football, more than any other sport, needs to focus on that link, because if you offer a commercial partner such as Amazon the ability for them to build a direct relationship with two million Australians, then that is very attractive.” That sort of third party investment, or a carriage partner, is probably the key to any OTT platform becoming reality for football. Already, leagues such as the one in Ireland have developed one – in their case in partnership with RTE Television. With the current Fox deal due to run out in July 2021, football is already looking at aligning the professional and grassroots competitions to a winter timetable. This could help, or hinder, OTT’s development. But one thing is sure: football can no longer fully rely on the traditional dividend provided by traditional broadcast models. Whether it is in part, in full, or in partnership, its future appears to be heading online. New and cheaper technology means producing content has rarely been easier or cost effective. This has been evidenced by A-League clubs starting to host their own pre-game programmes. But it could all hinge upon whether that oft-quoted two million playing base is as keen to watch the game as it is to play."
Danny Rose  Spurs defender tired of police stopping him to ask if car is stolen ,"Danny Rose has said he is regularly stopped by police in his car and questioned in various scenarios that would not happen if he were a white man as he detailed his anger and exasperation at racism in the UK. The Doncaster-born Tottenham defender, who has spent the second half of the season on loan at Newcastle, has been racially abused on the field, most recently when playing for England in Montenegro in March 2019. He had suffered similarly on England under-21 duty in Serbia in October 2012 and in the wake of the incident in Montenegro said he could not wait to walk away from the game because he was so disgusted by the racism that blights it – and the authorities’ response to it. Rose has now opened up on his experiences in wider society, saying he was first stopped by police as a 15-year-old and it was still happening to him at 30. “My friends have been there with me a lot of the time when it’s happened,” he told the Second Captains podcast. “The last time, last week, when I’d just been at my mum’s house, I had pulled up in a car park so the engine was off. The police pulled in and they brought a riot van, three police cars and they questioned me. They said they’d had a report that a car had not been driving correctly. “So I’m like: ‘OK, so why does that make it my car?’ I got my ID out and they breathalysed me. It’s just one of those things to me now. What can I do? Fifteen years of this on and off the field happening and there’s no change whatsoever.” Rose described being stopped by police as a regular occurrence. “Each time, it’s: ‘Is this car stolen? Where did you get this car from? What are you doing here? Can you prove that you bought this car?’”  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/08/03-59597-gnl.fw.20200803.ic.facup.mp3  He said there had also been incidents when he has travelled by train. “One of the last times I got on the train, I got on with my bags and the attendant said: ‘Do you know this is first class?’” Rose said. “I say: ‘Yeah, so what?’ They ask to see my ticket and I show the lady it and – this is no word of a lie – two people, white people, walk on the train after me and she says nothing. I asked: ‘Are you not going to ask for their tickets?’ and she just said: ‘Ah no, I don’t need to.’ “People might think it happens but to me that’s racism. These are the things I have to put up with, being stopped all the time and being asked if I know this is first class and to show my ticket.” Rose said he has been worn down by racism and doubts things can change. “This is everyday life for me but I feel embarrassed to even complain or bring it up when you see the incident in America where a man, a black man, lost his life at the hands of people who were supposed to protect and serve,” he said, referring to the death of George Floyd. “Whenever I do say things or complain, you do hear people say: ‘Well, you’re on this money so just get on with it.’ I just give up with hoping that things will change because that’s some people’s mentality towards racism.”"
"Sky Brown  


  Sometimes you fall but I wanted to show me getting up again ","“I thought it was kind of cool,” Sky Brown says as she remembers the first time she watched footage of her horrific skateboarding accident eight weeks ago. In the video, she flies up a 14-foot ramp, flips around in the air and comes swooping down on her board. Her skateboard makes a clattering whoosh as she zooms up the opposite vertical ramp and it’s only near the top that Brown loses control. The board veers to the right and she hurtles off the ramp. Brown’s arms and legs flail helplessly as if seeking some kind of invisible traction while she plummets 15 feet. The camera drops to the ground as her father runs towards his little girl. She was still only 11 years old and Brown suffered multiple fractures in her skull, lacerations to her lungs and stomach, a broken left arm and busted fingers on her right hand. The skateboarder, who will represent Great Britain at next year’s Olympic Games, where she hopes to win a medal, recovered in intensive care. Now, less than 60 days since her life nearly changed forever, Brown sits in her bedroom and smiles on Zoom. It’s early afternoon in London but, for Brown, it’s just after five in the morning in California. She chose this time slot for our chat because she wants to head out to the beach just after 6am to surf with her dad and nine-year-old brother, Ocean. Brown, who turned 12 three weeks ago and won a bronze medal at last year’s skateboarding world championships, is cheery at such a desolate hour of the morning. She insists the crash has not affected her desire to try out new tricks and believes her life was saved by her helmet. Brown also explains the accident was far more traumatic for her parents. Her mother, Mieko, is from Japan while her dad, Stuart, is an Englishman who moved to the US. “It was definitely hard for them,” she says of her parents. “They were both crying. And it was also really hard because only one of them could be with me and I couldn’t see my brother at all.” How did her mum and dad feel about skateboarding as she lay in hospital? “They both wanted me to stop. They were like: ‘Are you sure you want to skate again?’ They absolutely didn’t want me to – but that’s why I love them. They support me because they know I want to keep going.” Every contest I go for more than the gold medal. I want to push the limits and do my hard tricks Brown relives her hazy memory of the crash. “It was just a regular day. I like to skate at Tony Hawk’s place [Hawk is the world’s most famous skateboarder who, at the age of 52, has 5.8m followers on Instagram]. He has a 14-foot ramp and I did this trick which is a front side alley-oop, but when you do it you can’t really see where you’re going. So when I come down the ramp I’m facing the other way and I realised I was going off the edge. But it was really quick and I was knocked out.” What did she think when she heard her list of injuries? “It was pretty shocking and scary. My dad didn’t want to show me the video and he didn’t want me to look at my phone because there was so many messages. But, three days later, I asked again and that’s when I saw the video.” Soon afterwards Brown posted a video produced by people far older than her. The startling footage of her accident cuts away to screaming sirens, helicopters and beeping monitors. It melts into a shot of Brown wearing a sponsor’s shirt and surrounded by stuffed animals on her hospital bed as she says: “I don’t usually post my falls, or talk about them, because I want people to see the fun in what I do … but this was my worst fall.” Music swirls as Brown continues: “It’s OK to fall sometimes and I’m just going to get back up and push even harder. I know there’s a lot of things going on in the world right now … but I want everyone to know that, whatever we do, we’re just going to do it with love and happiness.” She sinks back on to her pillow and the video fades away. Brown can be commended for her courage but it’s a little unsettling. The cold hard sheen of corporate marketing seems at work even though, as Brown is so young, I choose the softer option and ask if the video was her idea. “My dad didn’t want me to post anything about the accident because we always want to show how fun and cool skateboarding is. We didn’t really want to show the accident – well, my dad didn’t. But even if you’re just walking you can fall. So I thought it was good to show that sometimes you fall. But I also wanted to show me getting up.” Brown scrunches up her face when I ask how long it took before she got back on her skateboard. “Probably two weeks. Maybe more. My dad and my brother were still skating but they wouldn’t go to the skatepark because they felt bad for me. They were skating on flat ground and so I did that. I did a kick-flip with my cast on and it felt amazing.” Did she feel any fear? “No. But I was trying to be careful. I didn’t want to fall on my arm but, other than that, no fear.” It’s easy to warm to Brown but few 12-year-olds post inspirational messages on social media or do Zoom interviews at five in the morning. Doesn’t she wish she could live a normal life? “I basically am a normal kid,” Brown says. “I just do sports.” It’s a pretty good answer and I know that Brown loves the creativity and freedom of skateboarding. She is also enthusiastic about inspiring other young girls to fulfil themselves. “I feel like sometimes girls don’t have that freedom,” she says. “You can be pretty. You can pick litter up. You can be really girly. But sometimes there’s a scary side to that. You’ve just got to be yourself.” On the wall above her bed a small frame contains the words Be You. “I saw it in a store and liked it,” Brown says of that statement of independence. Her favourite skatepark is at Venice Beach because, she says: “I can see the waves. I can smell the ocean. And there’re people watching you, so it makes you go harder.” But only a few girls skate at the park. “Maybe another two some days,” she says. “It’s getting better because before I used to see zero. But we need more. I get lots of girls contacting me because they now feel they can do sports too. They can do the same as boys.” Brown is featured in marketing campaigns alongside powerful sportswomen like Serena Williams and Megan Rapinoe but perhaps her real impact emerges in personal ways. She tells me about her friend Kako Yoshida – who is a professional surfer now. When they first met in Japan, Yoshida was too frightened to skateboard while Brown, despite being so much younger, was at home on a board in and out of the water. “I was about four, she was about 10 and I taught her how to skate. She was really scared in the beginning. But I told her she could do it and she just kept on growing, getting better and braver. She’s really cool and now one of the best surfers in Japan. She skates pretty good too.” Brown is proudest of the charity work she did in Cambodia with the Skateistan skateboarding project. Skateistan is supported by the Laureus Foundation which encourages the power of sport to combat violence against women and girls while eliminating gender discrimination. “I think Cambodia’s the most under-privileged country in Asia,” Brown says. “I went there to see Skateistan, which is a skate school that helps kids in unprivileged places get an education. It was scary. There was lots of guns and trash everywhere. I saw these girls picking up trash every morning. It was sad as well. But I made lots of good friends and been there a couple of times.” Were the girls in Cambodia amazed by her stunts? “Yeah. They’ve never seen a skateboard before. It was cool to show them a couple of tricks and they were trying to get on the board. I did the same in Cuba and they were having so much fun. That’s why I want to help.” Brown will become even more widely known when the 2020 Olympic Games are finally held in Tokyo next summer. She would have been trying to win a medal this week if the Games had not been postponed. “It was shocking. I felt like my dreams were fading. But people’s lives are way more important than dreams. Hopefully, fingers crossed, next year will be good.” There have been wildly overheated suggestions that Brown could help “save” the Olympics by attracting a completely new generation. It’s more accurate to measure how Brown has begun to understand the Olympics’ wider significance. “I’ve learned it’s amazing and that people all over the world watch it.” Is an Olympic gold medal her main aim? “Yes. I’m going to try my best to get it. But every contest I go for more than the gold medal. I want to push the limits and do my hard tricks.” Brown and her family usually spend six months of the year each in Japan and the US. This means her links to the UK are tenuous but the light touch of GB Skateboarding swayed Brown’s decision to represent her father’s country. Stuart Brown was reassured that no undue pressure would be placed on his daughter. She responds enthusiastically when I ask her what she thinks of Britain. “I love the accent. I love England. The food’s good. You have pretty good skateparks too. People were nice and sometimes it’s nice to be in the cold if you’re in the car.” There’s no need to seek warmth in the car on a Californian morning. “I’ve been surfing so much as it’s been hot,” Brown says. “As soon as we finish talking I gotta wake Ocean up so he can come surfing.” Sky and Ocean are planning to form a band. “We would love that,” she says. “I’m playing guitar and singing and my brother’s playing drums. We’re really close but sometimes we do fight. I don’t want us to be the perfect brother and sister.” That sounds reassuringly normal in these abnormal Covid times. She would love to return to Japan because “I really miss my friends there, my school, the food. We want to go back but right now it’s not looking too good. I’m not scared but I am trying to be careful. I keep my mask on and wash my hands, and try not to get it. But life’s short, so we don’t have to stay locked in for ever. We have to have fun too.” Laureus Sport for Good is a global charity that supports children and young people by using sport to end violence, discrimination, and disadvantage"
'They don't see us as human'  Beckham says NFL season should not happen  ,"Odell Beckham Jr, one of the NFL’s biggest stars, says the season should not go ahead as the Covid-19 pandemic continues its spread across the United States. “Obviously with everything that’s going on, it doesn’t make sense why we’re trying to do this,” the Cleveland Browns receiver told the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Monday. More than 155,000 people have died from Covid-19 in the United States, and the number of cases is on the rise across large parts of the country. Dozens of players have already opted out of the season due to concern over the virus – including seven from the New England Patriots – with games due to start next month. “We’re not ready for football season. So why are we trying to push forward? It’s obviously for their money,” Beckham said. “And that bothers me because there’s always been this – and I hate saying it like that – but the owners’ [attitude is], ‘Oh, we own you guys,’ and just kind of that unfairness going on that they don’t see us as human. I just feel like the season shouldn’t happen and I’m prepared for it to not happen and I wouldn’t mind not having it.” The Wall Street Journal interview was conducted in July, and Beckham has not said whether he will play for the Browns this season. Mary Kay Cabot, the Browns beat writer for the Cleveland Plain Dealer, reported on Monday that Beckham currently has no plans to opt out. Cabot reported Beckham has felt more comfortable with the idea of playing football again after seeing the precautions taken at the Browns’ training facility.  The NBA, MLB, MLS and NHL have all resumed competition in recent weeks. The NBA has resumed in an “isolation bubble” at Disney World in Florida, but Beckham said basketball’s conditions are different from those of football.  “I can understand basketball was already in the playoffs,” he said. “Five-on-five basketball in an arena is going to be more intense than regular-season games. Hooping is different than playing an 11-on-11 contact sport where there’s 80 people in a locker room.” In a YouTube discussion with other NFL stars last month, Beckham said he had briefly considered retiring from the game after sustaining an ankle injury in 2017. “I struggled to deal with that,” said Beckham. “Depression, mental health issues, being in New York, not really liking it.” The 27-year-old Beckham is one of the most explosive players in the NFL, and is a three-time Pro Bowler. However, he has struggled with injuries and has only played in all 16 regular-season games twice since entering the league in 2014. "

  Without seasonal workers, Australia may face a hungry summer ","As Victoria’s Covid-19 outbreak threatens to spiral out of control and beyond its borders, Australia faces another pandemic-related crisis. We are sailing into a food shortage and few are talking about it. This needs to change. In essence the issue is this: a large proportion of Australia’s harvest labour is done by people from abroad who are unable to travel. As the months tick down towards the summer harvest there are simply not enough people to pick the fruit. If this doesn’t change the result is likely to be shortages and price rises for horticultural products and, even more seriously, devastating hardship for our primary producers. There are solutions within our reach, if we act in time, but with each week that goes get by achieving them will be harder. Each year, at the peak of the harvest, Australia needs about 40,000 people to get its fruit and vegetables picked. In the 12 months to the end of March 2020 about 32,000 of these were backpackers doing the 88 days of farm work required to become eligible to stay another year in Australia. In roughly the same period, some 8,000 seasonal workers from the Pacific and Timor-Leste were working in Australia as part of the seasonal worker program. There is also a sizeable mostly-off-the-books workforce, often people on various sorts of student or humanitarian visas, as well as a relatively small cohort of professional pickers from Australia and New Zealand. Though these numbers are fuzzy, in the context of our current predicament their meaning is not. Many of the backpackers will have left ahead of the borders being closed. Of the remainder, running low on funds and missing their families, many will leave as soon as they can. Certainly more will not be coming any time soon. How many will be left is unknown, but it will be a lot fewer than 32,000. The situation with the seasonal workers is less clear. There are fewer than 7,000 still in the country, largely people who were working on six-month contracts when the borders shut. Like the backpackers their visas have been extended by 12 months, but also like the backpackers, many will be keen to return home as soon as flights are available and borders are open. Clearly, if nothing is done, a labour shortage on Australian farms going into the summer harvest season is a real possibility. One solution would be to reactivate and expand the seasonal worker program as a priority. Germany and Canada have already done this, reopening their borders to seasonal workers, subject to quarantine requirements and enhanced provisions intended to ensure the health and safety of the workers once they arrive. Such a path would be imminently realistic for Australia. A group of 200 workers from Vanuatu may be about to get the green light to work in the Northern Territory, according to one minister, and there is widespread support for the idea from both Pacific region governments and workers. Timor-Leste has upwards of 10,000 people impatiently waiting for the chance to deploy to Australia and has been actively seeking access for some of them. There are more than enough eager workers to make up the shortfall in backpacker labour, but bringing them here would require bureaucratic flexibility, political will, planning, multilateral consultation and, perhaps most of all, forward planning. There is no time to waste. Another benefit of expanding/reopening the program is that it will reduce the level of exploitation in the agricultural workforce. It is undeniable that rural and regional Australia have an issue with labour. Whether it be for the harvest, or year-round tasks in meat production or fisheries, primary producers are constantly searching for more reliable staff. The under-payment of backpackers and various sorts of off-the-books labour continues to be rife – the most comprehensive study on this matter so far found that one-third of them get less than the minimum wage. The program was set up specifically to avoid this type of exploitation and has largely been successful. A 2017 World Bank report found that most workers were satisfied with their experience: 91% said they would recommend it to others in their village. Another, in 2018, reported on the positive experiences of women within the program. Many workers choose to return again and again. Comparing the program with other sources of agricultural labour, a University of Adelaide report found that workers were far less likely to be exploited than backpackers, a view seconded by a government taskforce. While worker exploitation can, unfortunately, never be entirely legislated out of existence, the evidence that the seasonal workers program dramatically reduces it is strong. Ben Doherty’s reporting on the sad story of Silas Aru from Vanuatu who found himself underfed and underpaid in central Queensland makes for essential reading, but it is significant that when it came to light this case ended up in the federal court. One of the strengths of the program is that only authorised employers can participate, and authorisations can be removed without any court intervention, a strong incentive for them to play by the rules. This is very different from the situation with backpackers where there is not even a requirement that the government be informed before they are hired by a farmer. Reopening the seasonal worker program could be a moment in which the Australia-Pacific partnership comes of age, pointing the direction to a future defined by mutual help rather than development aid. It needs to be considered a matter of national priority.

  Unlike previous recessions, Australia did not enter this one with a strong economy ","One of the biggest problems for Australia is that unlike previous recessions we did not enter this one with a strong economy. The stores of economic success were already depleted after six years of flat household income growth and thus we have had a bust without any boom. Right now economic data is rather confusing as we try to discern what is real and what is artificial. Take the latest inflation growth figures. The big headline was that in the June quarter the CPI fell 1.9% – the biggest quarter of deflation since the Great Depression. That certainly is enough to make you have a slight panic attack. Deflation is not a good state of affairs – it means you are better off not spending your money now. That tends to lead to economic depression. And yet a very large contributor to that deflation was the artificial drop in prices for childcare, which during the June quarter were subsidised by the government. As a result childcare prices fell 95%: That is clearly not a “real” impact but one forced on the economy (for good reasons) by government policy. But let us not be fooled into thinking were it not for that policy things would be tripping along merrily. If we exclude childcare, which is included in the group of furnishings, household equipment and services, annual CPI growth goes from a fall of 0.3% to a rise of 0.5%. That seems better, but is still the lowest this century, while the Reserve Bank’s underlying inflation measure of the “trimmed mean” grew just 1.2% - the lowest ever recorded: But the underlying inflation growth also reveals the reality that even before the pandemic crisis things were amiss with Australia’s economy. The RBA targets underlying inflation growth of between 2% and 3% and yet for the past four and half years growth has been below 2%. That is not suggestive of an economy running hot. When we look at the latest final demand growth figures that came out last Friday we see much the same: While demand has fallen in the year to June, even in the 12 months to March demand in the economy grew just 1.4% and had been dribbling along at that level for the past five to six years. This is actually quite odd, and displays just how weird is this current recession. Normally a recession is preceded by a boom. In the years before targeting inflation in the early 1990s, Australia’s economy was very much a boom-bust one. One of the key reasons the RBA began targeting inflation in the early 1990s was the hope that such a policy would put an end to surging asset prices followed by sharp downturns. It led to the “great moderation” – where the economy was neither too hot nor too cold. At least until the global financial crisis destroyed the notion that recessions had been defeated. Before the 1980s and 90s recession and the GFC Australia’s economy grew at an average clip of more than 3.5% for two years. The late 1980s were so hot that even GDP per capita was booming at 3% growth before the bottom fell out: But in the two years before Covid hit, the economy grew a mere 2.3% on average – slower than even the long-term average, let alone what occurs during a boom. GDP per capita growth was so weak that during 2018-19 we could not even manage more than 1% average growth. The building sector is also a good example of how things have changed. Before the 1990s recession, private-sector residential building approvals grew by up to 60% – clearly unsustainable. But even before the GFC, building approvals grew by a solid 15%: By contrast, in 2018-19 building approval numbers were already falling. The difference is even more stark when we look at the growth of our living standards. Before both the 1990s recession and the GFC, real household disposable income per capita grew well above the 40-year annual average of 1.3%. But the past two years (actually the past six years) household incomes have barely grown at all in real terms. It means we are suffering a catastrophic economic downturn without even the usual bank of solid growth to draw on. We entered the recession in a weak state, and if all we do is return to that previous position the times of boom and bust will have been replaced not by a period of great moderation, but great despair."

  England's bungled response to Covid-19 leaves it vulnerable to more outbreaks ","With evidence of new outbreaks of Covid-19 across many countries in Europe, and a day-on-day rise in cases in England over the last week, concerns about an imminent second wave are well-founded. Some argue that the term “second wave” is itself unhelpful as, unlike the rise and fall of seasonal flu or the catastrophic second wave of the 1918 influenza pandemic, the causes of this particular resurgence are entirely due to human factors. The imposition of extreme lockdown restrictions in most countries around the world earlier this year was an act of desperation; in effect it represented the failure of disease control, not its success. In the absence of a vaccine or a fundamental evolutionary shift in the virus’s properties (it naturally becoming less deadly), the challenges of Covid-19 – a rapid case-doubling time, the infectiousness of pre-symptomatic cases, and the high mortality and potential for long-term health problems – that have made its control an imperative will not have gone away. With lockdown being eased around the world, opportunities for transmission have increased, reproduction numbers have gone up, outbreaks have increased in size, frequency and intensity, and renewed restrictions are being imposed in many countries including, on a regional basis, in the UK. Recently this rise in cases in Europe has led to the imposition of renewed quarantine for individuals entering or re-entering the UK from Spain. While these efforts to prevent fresh introductions arising in the UK are a sensible precaution, it must be recognised that international travel, while fundamental to the way Covid-19 initially spread from Wuhan in China, it is not fundamental to the problem we face now. In the UK and in England in particular, local incidence prior to travel restrictions had remained high. Recent rises in outbreaks in the north of England have led to the reintroduction of local, partial lockdown measures. While there are suggestions that it could be due to either imperfect social distancing, or possibly employment practices, there is no evidence that travel-based introductions are the culprit. Most of these new outbreaks have occurred in England, and it is here where the greatest concerns lie. As a result, the evidence that these outbreaks are becoming too frequent has now led to a slowing down of relaxation. In Scotland, a more cautious approach – combined with clear messaging from the devolved government about the approach to reducing lockdown – and more decisive action on the use of face masks have resulted in higher approval ratings and, therefore, a likely better engagement with Scotland’s approach to control. Combined with the natural advantages of a smaller, less dense population and a later arrival of Covid-19, Scotland has fared relatively well, despite criticisms of the early government response, disparities in testing rates across care homes and concerns over high death rates in what are some of the most deprived areas in the UK. Now, with few deaths in recent weeks, a path towards eradication is a tantalising possibility. Despite this relative success, Scotland faces many of the same challenges that England faces. Clusters of Covid-19 cases are still occurring, sometimes in the most unlikely places. So long as this is the case, the balancing act between the need for progress towards easing restrictions and the risks of a second wave will continue. With an R number that remains close to one the continued appearance of infection clusters and the prospect of increasing numbers of introduced cases from elsewhere, Scotland’s test and protect system – like England’s test and trace – may soon be stressed to new levels. Further challenges are likely to arise over the coming months. NHS staff have been stretched in many cases to their limits, and many other health conditions have been neglected in the fight to contain Covid-19. Economic uncertainty continues and the potentially destabilising impact of Brexit looms in December. Winter will likely mean increased time spent indoors and therefore less social distancing, with more frequent contacts in spaces where aerosol transmission is more likely. Cold and humid conditions may also be a factor; these are believed to play a role in other coronaviruses that infect humans and with influenza, and may also be a factor in the risks associated with Covid-19 transmission in abattoirs. Combined with the likely rise of seasonal influenza cases in those same months, the potential for the NHS to become overwhelmed are considerable. However, all is not doom and gloom. While lockdown has not been the cure for Covid-19, that was never its purpose. What it has done is to buy us time. Extensive systems for testing and tracing are now in place and while still subject to criticism, they will get better with experience and effort. Clean face masks and hand-washing will likely help reduce transmission, even when social distancing measures are relaxed. Clinical research has led to better therapies for the severely affected. Better surveillance tools are being developed. While the road remains long, we are now closer to a possible vaccine. And though direct comparisons are always difficult, there have been success stories such as New Zealand and British Columbia. Perhaps most remarkably, the example of Rwanda cannot be ignored, showing what dedication, hard work and experience can do even with limited resources. These examples show us that, while the path to successful Covid-19 control is fraught with difficulty, it is not impossible. • Rowland Kao is the Sir Timothy O’Shea professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh"

  In a pandemic, billionaires are richer than ever. Why aren't they giving more? ","A decade ago, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett did an important thing. They organized the Giving Pledge to inspire their fellow billionaires to donate more money to charity. On 4 August 2010, the first group of billionaires announced their intention to give away over half their wealth to charity. Over the last decade, they’ve been joined by many more. A decade later, however, two obvious problems have emerged. First, billionaire wealth has expanded at a phenomenal rate. Of the 62 living Pledgers who were billionaires in 2010, their personal wealth has increased by 95%, from $376bn to $734bn in 2020 dollars. They’d pledged to give away half. Instead, their wealth has nearly doubled. Not even the pandemic has slowed them down. From March to July 2020, the 100 US billionaires who are currently part of the Giving Pledge saw their total wealth increase $214bn – an increase of 28% in just four months. Many have stepped up to give during the pandemic. But their giving is not keeping pace with their exploding wealth. This leads to the second problem: in all likelihood, most of what they give away won’t go to on-the-ground charities, but to private family foundations often controlled by wealthy heirs and their advisers. Instead of supporting charities on the frontlines of problem solving, these billions end up sitting in tax-advantaged intermediaries. The notion that philanthropy is a private preserve, apart from the government, is a myth You may be thinking: it’s their money, they can do with it as they choose. But the notion that philanthropy is a private preserve, apart from the government, is a myth. The wealthier the donor, the more advantaged the charitable tax deduction becomes. For every dollar donated by a billionaire to their private foundation, we the taxpayers chip in as much as 74¢ on the dollar in lost tax revenue. For this reason, the philanthropy of billionaires is at best understood as a public-private partnership. We taxpayers have a legitimate interest in ensuring these funds serve the public interest. Through this lens, it is troubling that so much wealth is sequestered in private foundations and donor-advised funds – and that these are the fastest-growing areas of the giving sector. There is over $1.2tn parked in private foundations and an estimated $120bn in donor-advised funds. Private foundations are required to give away – or “pay out” in charity lingo – at least 5% of their assets each year, ostensibly to working charities. But administrative overhead, salaries and gifts to other tax-advantaged funds are counted toward this 5%. And many larger foundations treat this 5% as a ceiling, not a floor. Donor-advised funds, or DAFs, have no mandated payout at all. The donor takes a generous tax break when placing funds into the DAF, but the DAF does not legally have to pay out – ever. Donors can set up a DAF and pass it on to their grandchildren, who may or may not ever share the money with active charities. Private philanthropy has always been a form of power for wealthy donors. But as wealth inequality has exploded in recent decades, it’s concentrating that private power in even fewer hands – all subsidized by public taxpayers. This has troubling implications for charities, who are forced to cater to a smaller number of mega-donors, and our democracy. As governments at all levels face growing austerity from the Covid-19 pandemic and recession, billionaire philanthropy may well fill the vacuum for local services and institutions. But unlike local taxpayer dollars, billionaire foundations don’t answer to voters. So what can be done? The first step is for Congress to pass an “emergency charity stimulus”, a three-year mandate to increase the payouts of foundations and donor-advised funds. This would move $200bn to frontline charities doing urgent work during the pandemic – without costing taxpayers another dime, since these funds have been “paid for” by tax deductions. But ultimately we need a movement to democratize charitable giving. We should reorient the rules governing taxes and charity to discourage the concentration of power and decision-making. Taxpayers should not subsidize private fortresses of wealth and power that will exist for generations, controlled by the same families and their professional advisers. The implication for Gates, Buffett and the other Giving Pledgers is clear: give more money – not to private foundations, but directly to working charities and community-controlled foundations. Ten years from now, on the 20th anniversary of the Giving Pledge, the private family foundation should no longer exist.

  Boris Johnson's list of lords is a disgrace ","Boris Johnson’s latest nominations to the House of Lords are shameless. This is no reflection on the individuals concerned, merely on the decrepit state of the constitution that selects them, and on the man who is its current custodian. It reminds us of a theory constantly denied, but often posed: that membership of the British parliament can effectively be purchased. No British minister should ever have the gall to accuse foreign countries of corruption as long as this stain hovers over Westminster’s democracy. As a deliberative chamber of state, the House of Lords may seem little more than a retirement home for politicians and members of the professions, with a seasoning of diversity and eccentricity to add respectability. But its debates, were anyone to hear them, are of a far higher quality than the House of Commons. They are a welcome theatre in which the voice of age and experience is not drowned out by the mass media’s obsession with youth. That said, the Lords’ composition has become the secret sin of British politics. Lloyd George sold peerages for £50,000 each (£10,000 for a knighthood). Harold Wilson had his “lavender list”, with rich donors diluted by impecunious cronies. Such was the scandal surrounding “political honours” at the time that Wilson formally abolished them. They were renamed for “public service”, and everyone laughed. All 11 of Thatcher’s industrialist peerages between 1979 and 1985 went to corporate party donors.  In 1980 the new Labour leader, Michael Foot, was asked to nominate his first list of peers but refused. He said he did not believe in an unelected upper house. When his chief whip, Michael Cocks, made him change his mind, Foot presented a list of retired MPs. Cocks was appalled. “But none of them has any money,” he protested. There is supposedly an honours ethics committee through which peerages must pass, but it is clearly part of the game. The system is deeply corrupt. Party leaders have recently become unrestrained in their patronage. Rumours abound of the “going price” for a lord: £1m, £2m and so on. Tony Blair and David Cameron between them created 618 peers, almost as many as there were MPs. It is the one “thank you” they have within their power at no cost or inconvenience to themselves. The recently deceased Stuart Wheeler, donor of the biggest ever single sum to a British political party (£5m to the Tories in 2001), was singled out in his obituaries for having persistently declined a reciprocal peerage.  To keep the show within some bounds of dignity – clearly no concern of Johnson’s – a steady drip of persons of unblemished distinction and worth are also ennobled. Given the ex officio elevation of various clergymen, judges and scientists, numbers have duly rocketed to 772. These people have no need to attend parliament other than to collect £300 a day plus expenses. The image of a luxurious club is hard to expunge. Peers are currently outraged at the suggestion, actually from Johnson, that they might take their deliberations to the north of England during their chamber’s refurbishment. Apoplexy at the prospect of such refreshing contact with the common herd may yet decimate their numbers. Instead, peers are reportedly demanding millions to rebuild the interior of the nearby Queen Elizabeth II centre as a facsimile temporary chamber, and then put it back when they leave. They could perfectly well go to Church House opposite, as they did during the war. They are as shameless as their patron. This is all a pity. Few constitutions do without second chambers. In this day of a centralised, so-called elective dictatorship, the case for a check on the executive is powerful, especially where the lower chamber is vulnerable to executive capture, as in Britain. Today the House of Lords can amend legislation and delay bills by a year. But it should be able to do more. It should be able, like the US congress, to make the executive think three times, not just twice. But this is why its composition should be a matter of constitutional concern. More power can never be accorded the Lords as long as its appointments are a laughing stock. Endless proposals for change have bubbled to the surface, to be stymied by inertia and the collapse of the old royal commission system for bipartisan reform. Most involve forms of regional or sub-national election, but these suffer from the fact that standing in such party list elections – like those for the European parliament – are as confined to the patronage of political establishments as are the Lords. Parliaments in which parties choose who is likely to get elected are democracy diminished. I believe the unelected, senatorial model for a second chamber, as in Ireland, is in principle sound. Some mix of outstanding or significant citizens, chosen by occupation or location, would bring a different voice and viewpoint to hyper-metropolitan Westminster. Retired politicians can retreat to their clubs. Fresh voices, fresh faces, fresh outlooks are needed. The case for a House of Lords, or a house of somethings, remains convincing. Just not this one. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist • The image on this article was substituted on 4 August 2020. "
Parts unknown  Whole animal recipes from Feather and Bone ,"Traditional whole-animal butcheries have become a rarity in many developed countries. The overwhelming majority of domestic and export meat in Australia is traded through the commodity meat market. Much of the meat produced for this market will be sourced from farms that are organised around the primary goal of maximising turnover of animals. As a system that rewards volume and speed, it works brilliantly. But if you’re a farmer or butcher or consumer interested in other dimensions of value, such as traceable animal and environmental welfare standards, then it will come up short. This is because when a farmer sells into the mainstream commodity market, their animals disappear into a generic product pool. Filled with crusading zeal for a better food model, we decided that our commitment to transparency and a whole-animal practice meant two things. First, we would seek out diverse breeds of animals grown on farms managed with the goal of improving the entire ecosystem. Second, we wouldn’t buy boxed meat from a wholesaler, but instead would always buy meat on the bone direct from the farmer, offal and all. Of course, if your business is built around buying the whole animal, then you also have to sell it, which can be challenging. Many of us have lost the traditional skills that allowed us to prepare and consume the whole animal. Eating offal was something quaint our grandparents did, and these days we spend more time watching cooking shows than we actually do preparing food. All of this means we default to the cuts we know how to cook, and we’re less likely to choose the unfamiliar ones. Change is hard and change is slow but from little things big things grow. Feeds: 4-6 Active prep: 15 minutesCook: 8 hoursChill: Up to 24 hours “When we first started selling our pastured pork, I had only been eating meat for about seven years, after a decade of vegetarianism, and was determined to make use of every part of the animals we raise with such care. And so my crispy pig’s ear banh mi was born, of necessity and respect, inspired by regular visits to Vietnam over the years. Banh mi are best when there is a balance of fat, fresh, sweet, sour, salt and spice, all wrapped up in a crispy baguette with a soft centre. These crispy pig’s ear banh mi capture that formula perfectly, and also leave room for everyone at the table to self-determine their own ratios of each constituent flavour.” – Tammi Jonas, producer and activist For the pigs’ ears4 pasture-raised pigs’ ears1 leek, coarsely chopped3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed, still in skin50g palm sugar300ml pasture-raised pork bone broth or chicken stock200ml Shaoxing rice wine200ml soy sauce6 star anise1 cinnamon stick3 eggsPlain (all-purpose) flour, for dusting60g panko breadcrumbsLard or rendered animal fat, for deep-frying For the banh mi4-6 fried eggsFreshly made mayonnaise or aioli, to serve40g lightly pickled carrot2 cucumbers, cut into batonsLong red chilli, coarsely chopped, to tasteCoriander leaves, to serveFish sauce, to serveCrusty baguette or white rolls, to serve Start this recipe one or two days ahead. Preheat oven to 120C (235F). Place pigs’ ears in an ovenproof dish with leek, garlic, sugar, broth or stock, Shaoxing, soy sauce and spices. Cover with baking paper, seal tightly with foil, and braise for about eight hours, or overnight, until very tender. Place ears on a cooling rack in the fridge to dry out for up to one day. Slice ears into thin strips. Beat eggs in a wide bowl and place flour and breadcrumbs in separate bowls. Dust pigs’ ears in flour, shaking off excess, dip in egg, then coat in breadcrumbs. Melt 5cm fat in a deep, heavy-based saucepan until shimmering, then deep-fry ears for two to three minutes until crisp and golden. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack. Serve pigs’ ears in baguettes or rolls, and offer fried eggs, mayonnaise, pickled carrot, cucumber, chilli, coriander and fish sauce for people to fill as they like. Voila – a crunchy, salty, sweet, sour, spicy banh mi made with a part of the pig most people wouldn’t know what to do with. Uncommonly delicious. Feeds: 2-4, depending on the size of the liver Prep: 15 minutesCook: 30 minutes “I’m an artist, but my father was a butcher, and we had a nice little herd of Black Angus for a while. My first cooking job was to make the Saturday morning butcher’s breakfast, before I did the deliveries. So I used whatever morsels were around – liver, ends of bacon, kidneys, little lamb chops – fried them up in an old electric frying pan, then served them on a slab of thickly buttered bread. It was a tough gig, as butchers don’t like their meat ruined, so timing was everything. I love good fresh liver, served medium–rare, with jammy onion and pan-roasted tomatoes. Sear the liver at the last minute while the sourdough bread is toasting.” – Christopher Hodges, Feather and Bone customer 40g butter, plus extra for spreading2 tablespoons olive oil2-4 brown onions (1 per person), diced250g cherry tomatoes, halved1 lamb, goat or calf (veal) liver, rinsed, membrane removed, sliced into 1.5cm strips1 handful flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped2-4 slices sourdough bread Add a generous knob of butter to a frying pan over medium-high heat. Swirl for two to three minutes until lightly browned, then add a good dash of olive oil. Add onion and a large pinch of salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring gently, for 15-20 minutes. The onion will slowly turn golden, then brown, sweet and yummy. Meanwhile, heat a separate frying pan over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes – they’ll sizzle as they hit the pan – then add a bit more butter, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, turning once, for five minutes or until lightly browned and juicy. Drizzle liver all over with remaining olive oil. Heat a heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat, add liver and sear it quickly, without turning, for one minute until sealed and caramelised a little, then turn it quickly and sear for another minute until nicely browned but still rare in the middle. Transfer to a plate, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and top with parsley, then cover with an upturned bowl or a lid – it will keep cooking so by the time you serve it will be cooked through but still pink in the middle. Meanwhile, toast sourdough in a toaster. Butter toast, and top with onions, tomatoes and liver to serve. Feeds: 4-6 as a shared entréePrep: 20 minutesCook: 2 hours (five minutes with pressure cooker)Special equipment: Pressure cooker (optional) “This recipe is from northern China, where middle Asian and Arabian influences blend with the complex beauty of Sichuan cooking to shine brightly. It often uses sliced pork belly but I think lamb tongue, with its tender buttery texture, is much more luxurious. This recipe is also a good way to use up any leftover roast lamb.” – Norman Lee, Feather and Bone customer For the tongue500g lamb’s tongues2 small star anise2 cloves½ cinnamon stick1 tablespoon Sichuan peppercorns3 bay leaves1 tablespoon sunflower oilCoarsely chopped coriander leaves, to serve1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds Numbing chilli-oil vinaigrette25g crushed Sichuan peppercorns100 ml sunflower oil2 tablespoons black (Chinkiang) vinegar1 tablespoon chilli oil (I use Lao Gan Ma brand)1 garlic clove, finely chopped Tahini sauce1 tablespoon tahini1 tablespoon sesame oil½ tablespoon light soy sauce If you have a pressure cooker, fill it with the minimum amount of water, then add tongues, star anise, cloves, cinnamon, Sichuan pepper, bay leaves and one teaspoon of salt. Heat until it comes to full pressure, cook for five minutes, allow to cool, then drain. Alternatively, add tongues, spices, bay leaves and salt to a large saucepan, add enough water just to cover, bring to the boil, skim surface, then reduce heat to medium-low and simmer gently for two hours or until just tender – a skewer should pass through with only a little resistance. Rest the tongues until they’re cool enough to handle, then peel off the skin with a small knife while they are still warm. Slice tongues thinly lengthwise – you should get about four slices per tongue. Meanwhile, to make vinaigrette, warm crushed Sichuan pepper in oil in a small saucepan over low heat for three to five minutes or until fragrant – be careful, it can burn quickly. Remove from heat and steep for 10 minutes to extract all the fragrance. Strain, discarding Sichuan pepper, and combine oil with remaining ingredients. Whisk all tahini sauce ingredients with three tablespoons of warm water until smooth and silky. Add more water if needed; sauce should be a pouring consistency. Season to taste with salt. For a cold summer dish, arrange tongue on a plate. (For a warm dish, heat oil in a frying pan over medium–high heat, add tongues, and cook, turning halfway, for three to five minutes until crisp and golden.) To serve, spoon the tahini sauce over. Splash on the chilli-oil vinaigrette, pile chopped coriander in the middle, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. Toss at the table and serve.

Fashion  The story of Marine Serre's crescent-moon catsuit ,"“Thank you, Queen, for always making us feel so loved through your art,” Adele wrote on Instagram, kneeling under a still from Beyoncé’s Black is King. The film was released on Friday, and Adele, like a paid-up member of the Beyhive, was twinning with her idol in a Marine Serre crescent-moon top. Versions of the same top, and a similarly adorned catsuit, have been seen on the most powerful women in entertainment this year including Lorde, Rosalia, Dua Lipa and Kylie Jenner. Since the weekend, there has been a 426% increase in searches for the brand, according to lyst.co.uk. In its ubiquity it has become the 2020 equivalent of 2016’s  DHL T-shirt from subversive cult label Vetements: a high-fashion talking point in non-fashion circles.  Thank you Queen for always making us all feel so loved through your art ♥️♥️ A post shared by  Adele (@adele) on Aug 1, 2020 at 11:09am PDT The 27-year-old French fashion designer Serre – who got the Karl Lagerfeld seal of approval when he described her in one of his final interviews as having “a will of steel” – made the upside down crescent the logo of her eponymous label when it launched 2017 after she won the LVMH prize (fashion’s version of the Booker). Since her debut show in 2018 she has since put her distinctive motif on leggings, dresses, balaclavas and her Nike capsule, as well as tops and bodysuits. The logo may only be three years old but it is in the lineage of Versace’s Medusa, Nike’s swoosh or Gucci’s Gs: simple, bold and hard to forget. “It harks back to the best logos, which essentially trade on being cult signifiers that you only know about if you’re in the know,” says British Vogue’s digital director, Ellie Pithers. It goes without saying that the shape is “Instagram-perfect”, too. In Already, the segment of Black is King where Beyoncé is wearing the Marine Serre catsuit, she sings: “Be your own king / Make nobody come rule your world.” Its message of self-determination fits into the symbolic meaning of the crescent moon. A symbol of life and fecundity, the moon was also seen as a female deity, epitomised by goddesses such as Artemis and Diana, who was depicted with a crescent on her brow – it stands in symbolic contrast to the sun because it reflects light instead of producing its own.  Bodily inscriptions, performative subversions - Marine Serre’s BORDERLINE styling garments are utterly close to the skin as well as the brand’s identity, eclipsing the binary between body and wear. Photo & styling @benoitbethume Looking forward hugging you again A post shared by  MARINE SERRE - FUTUREWEAR (@marineserre_official) on Mar 27, 2020 at 9:56am PDT “The moon for us is like an icon, an emblem, an image, a representation, a flag, a language, a metaphor, an object of what we believe in: crossing boundaries, hybridity and freedom,” Serre told Dazed and Confused. Its role in all things astrological, which is enjoying a renaissance, is also significant (almost 30% of Americans believe in astrology according to a Pew research poll). “There’s a kind of ambiguity or a ‘fluidity’, as Marine told me when I interviewed her for Vogue,” says Pithers. “It’s wonderfully discreet but instantly recognisable at the same time, which is why I think it’s struck a chord.” A trademark of Serre’s label has been her unwavering commitment to sustainability – upcycling makes up 50% of her collection. And the themes of environment and dystopia feed into her work. She described her autumn/winter 19 collection to Vogue as “after the apocalypse, a group of friends are underground – a community together. It’s a safe zone in which a new world is being created, a future world, a new way to see fashion.” Beyoncé wore a black-and-red crescent-moon catsuit from this collection to the NBA play-offs last May. Like the Black is King one, it covered her hands, arms and legs – giving the impression of a second skin. In the context of pandemic dressing and social distancing, this look is eerily prescient. With this reference of “apocalypse chic” and the current climate of pandemic anxiety, the crescent moon catsuit feels chillingly appropriate. "
"How we met  


  He spoke to me in a French accent and I went weak at the knees ","Peter Kavanagh flew to Copenhagen from his home in Brighton for a long weekend in May 2014. “I went to a street party for the Eurovision song contest and then discovered there was an afterparty going on,” he says. He made his way to Freetown Christiania, an area of the city that was taken over by hippies in the 1960s and now exists as an international commune. “I was really excited, as it’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to go.” The party was in full swing when he spotted Franck Thierry across the room. Franck was living in Copenhagen at the time, and had been attending another house party with friends before the club night. “He spoke to me in a French accent, and I went weak at the knees,” laughs Peter. Franck noticed his partner’s dancing. “I loved Peter’s whole look. We spent the next three hours chatting.” As the sun began to rise, Franck invited Peter back to his home in Copenhagen. “I was sitting on the back of his bike and got my own personal tour of Christiania,” says Peter. “It was so romantic.” As well as the instant attraction, the pair had plenty in common. “We both realised we loved gardening, so we chatted about that for ages,” says Franck. “He didn’t go back to his Airbnb until the very end of the weekend.” As soon as Peter left for the airport, Franck made plans to come and visit him in Brighton. “When I landed in Gatwick, he texted me to say he was coming the next weekend. I was really excited as otherwise getting home could have been a real downer.” When Franck arrived, he fell in love with Brighton. “We had this incredible weekend together. The sun was shining the whole time.” At the time, Franck was working as a freelance massage therapist, while Peter had flexible hours as the owner of a hairdressing salon. It meant they could see each other regularly throughout the summer. “I think the cheap flights from easyJet played a big part in our relationship,” jokes Franck. After several months of “fun and hedonism”, they started finding it harder to say goodbye at the end of their weekends together. In the autumn, Franck moved to Brighton. “I am originally French, but had been living in Copenhagen for 34 years,” he says. “It was quite a drastic move and I think some of my clients thought I was mad.” He has never regretted it. The couple found an allotment together and Franck began working in Peter’s salon. “All the clients love it when Franck is in charge of doing the hair washing because of his massage skills,” says Peter. After splitting from his first civil partner after a few years (Denmark was the first country in the world to legalise civil partnerships, in 1989) and losing his second to Aids in the 90s, Franck had no plans to marry again. “Peter changed my mind, though” he laughs. “He insisted.” The couple got married in Brighton in August 2016, carrying flowers they’d picked from their allotment. “There were just a few friends there. We both wore our gardening clothes, as it’s what we always wear,” says Peter. They are now happily settled with their dog. During lockdown, they spent all their time gardening and have now managed to reopen their hairdressing salon. “Franck always gives me confidence,” says Peter. “He’s so attentive, charming and romantic. He’s also really sexy.” Franck says they bonded through music and a shared philosophy on life. He believes they also have a rare spiritual connection. “Sometimes you just really understand someone. I’m old enough to know that doesn’t happen very often. I think our personalities complement each other well.” Peter jokes that Franck tells him “to calm down” quite a lot, but agrees their differences balance each other out. “From that first night when we were cycling through Copenhagen at sunrise there was something special. We’re really lucky to have found each other.” Want to share your story? Tell us a little about you, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here."
"Jamie Oliver on fame, failure and fighting obesity  


  I'm actually quite shy. I don't like a ruck ","Jamie Oliver appears on the Skype screen looking a bit harassed. He’s at Jamie Oliver HQ and his backdrop is a photographic mural of a giant waitress handing a menu to someone who, I finally figure out when he moves his head, is a young, carefree Jamie Oliver. The contrast between these two faces of the same man – I’m talking about mood, rather than the cruel weathering of time – is striking. He started out as the living embodiment of the carefree lad about town, and now has the frazzled look of a man who is being badgered by seven people at once. It’s partly my fault. In many ways, I am here to harass him. Oliver’s absolute passion, besides food itself, is fighting childhood obesity, an issue that has just landed at the top of the news agenda thanks to the government’s new obesity strategy, which will include banning junk food advertising and putting calorie counts on restaurant menus. Oliver is delighted by the announcement, as he was by the former prime minister David Cameron’s work on the issue, and says it was only derailed by Brexit. But his thinking, to my mind, doesn’t make sense – he is clear about the fact that the root cause of obesity is poverty: indeed, he shows me a graph he has had embossed in gold, and put in a gold frame, which shows that children from poor families are twice as likely to end up obese, that they – in his words – “live on the planet less time than their affluent friends”. So I find it absurd for him to laud two prime ministers who have done so much to cause poverty in families, from benefit cuts to sanctions, from abandoning child-poverty targets to gleefully overseeing the introduction of a food-bank culture in this country, and congratulate them for taking obesity in childhood seriously. When I put this to him, his answer infuriates me even more: “Some of the most nutritious food in the world is cheap,” he says. “Please don’t worry. But it doesn’t mean anything without education and access. Of course there’s cost, but if you have the knowledge, you’ll know how to beat the cost. Mate, I’ve spent 25 years travelling the world, and the poorest communities always have the best food. I’ll take you to Costa Rica, I’ll take you to Italy, I’ll take you to the council estates of Sardinia and Greece, and the food will blow your mind.” My criticism is unjust, I realise, as our conversation unfolds. Oliver may not openly attack the government, but he is, in some ways, quite trenchantly anticapitalist. In 2019, he set about turning the Jamie Oliver Group, including his remaining restaurant business, into a B Corporation, a certification for businesses that, according to its website, “meet the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance profit and purpose.” It’s a wildly exacting process, or as he puts it: “It’s fucking hard. It makes the Inland Revenue look like pussycats. They are properly in your laundry drawer, getting into your pants, having a good look.” Oliver has been preoccupied with certain social justice issues for many years – the nutrition in school meals, but also the realities of work, career progression and opportunity. Or, as he puts it, “how we train our staff, how we had pot washers becoming head chefs”. But he has a new articulation of what “good” looks like to him. He believes in the arduous process of things such as becoming a B Corp, he believes in experts, bureaucracies, rules: “We cannot and we should not trust one person assuring you jack shit,” he says. “If you look at rhetoric around business and trade, it’s a lot of what seem like perfectly decent people saying the right things, disarming you, assuring you, and what’s really going on, the public doesn’t notice. It’s like a snail, you think he’s not doing anything, but put him on a time-lapse and you’ll see him doing all sorts … eating, foraging, shagging, all sorts.” It’s pretty indirect, as any statement would be that arrived via a densely complicated snail analogy, but it does sound a bit like a plea for better, more mature business and politics. Simultaneously, he is attacked by the right, for his nannying ways, getting in our Turkey Twizzlers, telling us what to do. There’s not a lot he can say without the tabloids going after him – a fact he references frequently – and this has been true ever since he launched his school-dinners campaign in 2005. “That was my training ground for taking a lot of shit even when they [the newspapers] were talking crap. To this day I get a lot of shit for taking away Turkey Twizzlers. What we did was create the minimum standards for meat products in school, which didn’t exist before. Even though I knew I was smugly righteous, I felt very passionate. “When Mrs Thatcher took away the state providing the food and put it out to competitive tendering in the 80s, cost became the only measure. If you wanted to sell dog food in this country, there were robust standards which if you breached you’d go to court. There was none of that with what we fed our children. And I changed that. If you look at it like I was a drug dealer, what I did was clean up the product, stop cutting it and gave them better gear. I did the opposite of taking meat products away. I guaranteed a minimum of 65% meat!” I think most of his opponents know this, but his card has been marked, now, as one of those pesky celebrities who care about the world and refuse just to disappear into their own wealth (see also, Gary Lineker – and I don’t doubt they’ll be coming for Marcus Rashford one day soon). The result is a kind of glee when things go badly for him, as they recently have. His restaurant chain Jamie’s Italian went under last year, taking with it all but three of his 25 UK restaurants and 1,000 jobs. It was a blow: “I had my arse kicked for the past three years trying to save Italian and I pride myself on having done the best version of bad.” As much as he weathered the failure (he still has a number of franchises outside the UK), he warns that it told a bigger story. “I always said what’s happening to me is like a weather vane of what’s going to happen to everyone else. Can you bring values into the mainstream? Can you bring values into the high street? It can mean working with small farmers, buying higher welfare meats, actually cooking on site, which means actually employing more people, which means actually training people. But honestly, mate, we nearly got there.” In a rare display of pessimism, he is worried for the British restaurant industry, and not just because of Covid-19. Indeed, the virus doesn’t come into it. “If you look at everyone doing well at the moment, they are basically prepping and shifting fairly low-quality food. So the thing I’m most worried about at the moment is the actual business of cooking and service is hugely under threat. Because it doesn’t pay the bills to care.” Even though his restaurant chain going under was a bruising experience, it hasn’t dented his readiness for a scrap. Today, he launches into an unexpected broadside against vending machines. “Does anyone give a shit about vending? Of course not. But it’s huge. Often in workplaces that don’t supply lunch or dinner, [employees] have no other source of nutrition. I’m not saying don’t have a KitKat, because if you want one, God knows you should have one. I’m saying if you’ve got 5,000 people taking 999 calls, with three shifts a day and no food on offer for two [shifts], it would be morally right to have choice. If there’s only crap [food available], that’s not democracy.” Again, I find it a little bit frustrating that this has to be about food: because really it’s about conditions at work, the responsibilities of the employer, and the real answer is not to have cucumber batons in the vending machine, it’s to join a union. But I feel bad, because he knows in advance what the response will be (he’s trying to take away our KitKats!), and he wades in anyway. “I actually don’t like fighting. I’m actually quite shy. I don’t like getting into rucks,” he says ruefully. I know that to be true, because I remember how he was in the beginning. It would be a reach to say I did the first interview with Oliver, but it was early days, maybe 1999, when he was already the Naked Chef, but un-famous enough that he needed a gimmick, so he came to my flat on his scooter to cook dinner. My sister was there and resolutely refused to leave, so he had to take all this really carefully considered food – including individual chocolate fondants – and divide it into three. His whole shtick was that he was truly impossible to dislike. He’d feed you food you weren’t expecting – pasta with candied fruit, we were definitely not expecting that at the end of the last century – and you’d have to like it, because you liked him. There was no front to him, no armour. He asked us where our fellas were, and my sister said scornfully (she’s got something against Waiting for Godot, don’t know what), “they’re at the Barbican, seeing some Beckett,” and he said, “what’s a beckett?” He didn’t start out a firebrand. If anything, he was a pleaser. And he describes, 12 years into his career, a gear change: “I think it was looking in the mirror in disbelief, going: ‘Bloody hell, this kid that grew up special needs.’ And there I was, I had a house, I’d sold 20m books. “That’s not showing off, that’s saying I have a longitudinal relationship with the public. That’s a vote.” And there is something in the way he tackles injustice, that he sees people as constituents as much as compatriots. Later this month, he’s bringing out a book called 7 Ways. It’s a neat idea, he’s crunched the data on the ingredients people buy in supermarkets every week (we all constantly buy the same things, it may not surprise you to learn) and come up with new things to do with them. So I asked him about it, not even to be polite, but out of genuine interest. And he groaned. “Please don’t do this. Please don’t make me sound like that kind of arsehole. Don’t make it sound like I say all this stuff, but all I’m trying to do is sell more books.” It was a bit chastening, actually. I disagree with some of the politics, but I would never query whether or not this was a person trying to do good in the world. It’s not the rucks that have tired him out, it’s the world of cynics, waiting for the gotcha moment. So anyway, I probably will buy his book, but let the records show that was never the point of all this. • This article was amended on 3 August 2020. It was the whole of the Jamie Oliver Group, not just the remaining restaurant business, that the chef set about turning into an ethical “B Corporation”. "
Nigel Slater's midweek dinner  Spaghetti with broccoli and herb sauce ,"Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. Meanwhile, cut 500g of broccoli into small florets and cut the main stalk into small pieces. Add salt to the water, then introduce the broccoli, stems first, followed a minute or so later by the florets, and cook for 3 minutes. Drain the broccoli and set it aside. Cook 250g of spaghetti in deep, generously salted boiling water for about 9 minutes. While the pasta is cooking, make the dressing: put 10 large mint leaves, 15 large basil leaves, a handful of parsley and 6 tbsp of olive oil in a blender and process everything to a dark green dressing. Add 2 tbsp of white wine vinegar and a little salt. Transfer the dressing to a bowl and add 1 tsp of capers, and another of bottled green peppercorns, along with 1 tbsp of their pickling liquor. Drain the spaghetti then toss it with the broccoli and the green dressing, and serve it immediately. Enough for 2 A lovely way in which you can keep the broccoli crisp is to cook the florets in boiling, salted water for 3 minutes then drain them and plunge them straight into a bowl of water containing ice cubes. The cold, crunchy vegetables are a fine contrast with the soft, hot strands of spaghetti. Anchovies can be finely chopped and incorporated into the green dressing. I like to fry a handful of breadcrumbs, or better, I think, focaccia crumbs, in olive oil until they are crisp, then scatter the crumbs over the spaghetti just before serving.

The Goopification of grapes  Why 'clean wine' is a scam ,"Cameron Diaz gives a happy sigh. “I’m really excited,” she says to her friend Katherine Power. On the table are two bottles of their new wine, Avaline, launched mid-July. “We were mad for a while,” adds Diaz. “You were a little bit more mad than I was. You had some real anger.” Anger? About wine? When Diaz and Power decided to make their own wine, they discovered there’s more to it than fermented grape juice. “No transparency, no labelling,” says Power, so shocked by what she found, she threw out all her wine. The pair, speaking on Instagram, say they became determined to make a “clean”, chemical-free wine and are now, according to their publicist, on a mission “to bring transparency to the wine industry”.  If you’re wondering how @avaline came about, here’s our story! 💕 @katherinepower #avaline A post shared by  Cameron Diaz (@camerondiaz) on Jul 9, 2020 at 3:11pm PDT They’re not the only ones. Out of nowhere has come Good Clean Wine, which “pairs with a healthy lifestyle”; the Wonderful Wine Company, which offers “wellness without deprivation”; and Scout & Cellar, a multi-level marketing company that boasts of its “clean-crafted wine” and intends to “disrupt the wine industry and do better for the planet”, among others. Dr Creina Stockley sighs when she hears this over Zoom. “I’ve been in the industry for close to 30 years and this comes up periodically, just under different names” – “minimal intervention” is one she remembers – “it’s a marketing exercise.” A pharmacologist and lecturer at the University of Adelaide, Stockley is a world authority on wine additives and processing aids, the heart of this issue. Unlike the food industry, winemakers don’t have to list ingredients. This has opened a door for opportunists, who profit by claiming that other wineries fill their wines with noxious chemicals (they don’t). The clean wine companies are chasing a lucrative prize – a piece of the $52.5bn wellness market. A Scout & Cellar recruitment video notes 68% of consumers will pay more for products if they’re free of ingredients perceived as bad; disparaging the competition is good marketing. It’s also working; the company reportedly made $20m in 2018, its first year. Strangely, for companies committed to ripping the lid off the wine industry, the clean wine gang is pretty quiet about where their own wines come from, and most declined to be interviewed. Where many wineries love giving encyclopaedic detail about the hill where their grapes are grown, for example, the Wonderful Wine Company simply says its white comes from “France”. “People are very interested in origin stories,” says Brian Smith, CEO of Winc Wines, which launched the Wonderful Wine Co in May, “but the modern consumer is looking for ‘how does this fit into my life?’” Winc Wines, founded by Smith and Geoff McFarlane, is one of the US’s most sophisticated online direct wine businesses. Asked how Wonderful Wines offer “wellness without deprivation”, Smith says they use organic grapes “wherever possible” and don’t manipulate their wines. Which is an interesting claim, because wine doesn’t make itself. If you drop Vitis vinifera grapes in a tub and leave them, they ferment, but what you’ll get is vinegar or cloudy, sour wine. Winemaking is both art and science and, over centuries, winemakers have learned to prevent taints and spoilage, from using sulfur dioxide as an anti-bacterial and antioxidant, to dropping egg whites into the wine to remove harsh-tasting tannins, a process known as fining. Yet only 40 years ago, a wine could be good one year and horrible the next. Since then, an explosion of microbiology, chemistry and viticulture research has driven a quality revolution. Today’s winemakers have an array of yeasts, antimicrobials and fining agents to choose from. Some function as ingredients that go into the wine, like extra acidity to perk up grapes from warm regions. Others are processing aids, mostly used to take things out of the wine. Some have terrifying names, like polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP), but it’s the same binding agent found in aspirin tablets. It’s sometimes used to reduce colour, to achieve pale pink rosés. Such aids are legally defined and heavily regulated, and they don’t stay in the wine. But all this research has also allowed commercial winemakers to create bland, homogeneous wines that taste the same each year, regardless of vintage variation. In the US, some mass-market red wines have grape concentrate added – the best known of which is Mega Purple – to give extra colour and sweetness. It’s illegal to add concentrate in the EU, where nothing can be added that changes the essential nature of a wine. Many wine lovers are appalled by such practices, which render terroir – the origin, or sense of place – redundant and the backlash has led to a new category: natural wines. These are made by the “nothing added, nothing taken away” principle, usually from organic grapes. But between natural and mass-market wines lies a vast and varied world. Just because winemaking tools exist doesn’t mean people use them – wineries don’t spend money on things they don’t need and artisanal winemakers, in particular, pride themselves on their hands-off approach. Stockley says, in any case, that modern wine needs less intervention than in the past, partly because winemakers have “learned to make things smarter and better”, but mostly because of improved grape growing. Some winemaking aids are no longer permitted; until 1997, animal blood could be used for fining. Ferrocyanide, which Scout & Cellar claims is a common additive in commercial wines, was a processing aid that’s no longer legal. So why not list ingredients? Dr Ignacio Sánchez Recarte, secretary general of the Comité Européen des Entreprises Vins (Ceev), which represents the EU’s wine sector, says it’s because wine isn’t made by an industrial process. While, say, a commercial bakery works to a strict, unchanging recipe, winemaking decisions change each vintage. Asking a small winery to update labels every year would impose an economic burden. “If you have anything in the wine with potential allergenic effects, you are obliged to indicate that on the label,” however, and he adds the wine sector understands that modern consumers want transparency. Legislative change is under way in the EU. “I expect that by the end of 2022 there will be labels on wine,” he says, adding they will either be traditional labels or e-labels. They will list ingredients, not processing aids – nor will they show if the producer used pesticides. “Now you’re opening up a can of worms,” says Jamie Goode PhD, wine writer and author of wine textbooks. “You can’t grow grapes from Vitis vinifera without spraying eight to 14 times a year. The problem is mildew and then, at the end of the growing season, rot.” One of wine’s paradoxes is that the most prized, expensive grapes come from regions prone to fungal diseases, which can only be treated with commercial pesticides or, for organic growers, applications of copper sulfate. “It’s all about the concentration,” says Goode, adding: “There are strict regulations concerning their use and concerning residue levels that are permitted. Wine is one of the most regulated and safe products there is.” Promising ultraviolet light therapies are being trialled that may eliminate pesticides forever but, for the moment, there is another potential way to avoid them. It’s to farm in drier, warmer areas with less disease pressure, like Languedoc in southern France – birthplace of the Wonderful Wines white. There are plenty of warm regions producing grapes at lower cost. California also has a grape glut right now and there’s more wine in tanks than many wineries know what to do with. Some use the best for themselves, then quietly sell the rest to what’s known as the bulk wine market, where everything from commodity grapes to certified organic wines are sold. Wineries also use their excess to make on-demand wines for buyers. In a twist, these “exclusive” wines often come from big wineries; despite being thoroughly conventional, they can even be marketed as “minimal intervention” or “clean”, because these are meaningless terms. It’s a type of wine known as private label, which can be highly profitable because the seller doesn’t have vineyards or wineries to maintain. Most winemakers talk obsessively about their land and heritage (try and stop them), so if these details are missing or vague, the wine could be private label, although some mass-market brands also omit this information. Diaz and Power’s Avaline, for example, is silent on who makes it. Then there’s Scout & Cellar’s $25 Gallivant chardonnay, whose web copy says it’s made by a fifth-generation family winery founded in Monterey in 1883, but not which one. In contrast, consider the $18 Wente Vineyards Morning Fog chardonnay, which has a downloadable technical sheet explaining the region, soils and winemaking. Coincidentally, it’s also made by a fifth-generation family winery founded in 1883 in Monterey. Unfortunately, all wine, however it’s made, contains a dangerous chemical: alcohol. No matter how sustainably the grapes are grown nor how consciously it’s made, there is no wine that won’t deliver a hangover if you drink too much. Wine is not a wellness potion. It’s a snapshot of time, a manifestation of the place and the people who made it, which works a special magic when paired with friends and food. When it comes to clean wine, the only thing being cleaned is your wallet. Felicity Carter is the editor-in-chief of Meininger’s Wine Business International magazine"

  Hardcore pop fans are abusing critics – and putting acclaim before art ","The album rating system at US publication Pitchfork is one of the most silly and nerdy things in music journalism. The Guardian’s five-star system looks neanderthal compared with Pitchfork’s decimal-point ratings, where an album can get 3.2 (oof), 6.5 (meh), 9.2 (wow) and so on. 0.0 has been used as a cruel joke; a perfect 10, only earned by Fiona Apple and Kanye West in the last decade, is the grail cup of hip culture. This 100-point marking scheme has since been adopted by the website Metacritic, who aggregate reviews from English-language publications to arrive at an overall percentile score for albums, games and films. It’s a useful tool for time-poor people to quickly see what consensus has formed around. Last week, Taylor Swift’s surprise new album Folklore was released to an array of high scores, including five stars in the Guardian, and its Metacritic score cruised into the mid-90s. But later reviews were slightly more critical, including Pitchfork’s 8.0, dragging Swift down to a current score of 89. 89 is still much higher than most albums released this year, but Swift’s fans weren’t happy. The author of the New York Times’s semi-sniffy review, Jon Caramanica, had thousands of them in his Twitter mentions, posting images of Swift doctored to make her look like a terrifying witch along with hexes spelled out in runes that, translated by Google, read: “Anyone who comes after the dark queen will die alone and burn forever.” This is the dark, flamboyant humour beloved of the “stan” culture of pop superfans, and in this case, quite funny. But another attack on Jillian Mapes, Pitchfork’s reviewer, was very serious: “Contact info both old and current was leaked, down to a photo of my home,” she wrote on Twitter. “I’ve gotten too many emails saying some version of, ‘you are an ugly fat bitch who is clearly jealous of Taylor, plz die’ … It sucks to be scared of every person milling about outside or feel like you can’t answer the phone.” Her overwhelmingly positive review nevertheless tarnished the numerical perfection conferred by Metacritic, hence the attack. This weekend Kitty Empire, the Observer’s pop critic, was also the recipient of shocking abuse on Twitter in the wake of her three-star Folklore review, with users calling for a repeat of the action taken against Mapes: “We need a 100/100 do it or some shit will leak,” wrote one user who later added: “We’re finding your address, watch out for the windows.” This is horrible, anti-artistic behaviour from people wanting total consensus. That would be a strange and damaging thing to want even in politics, where some degree of consensus is necessary to make a democracy run. In art though, this impulse is downright fascistic. The backdrop to it is a lessening importance for album reviews. Once, you wanted to know if a CD you might spend £16 on – a fortune in the 90s – was any good, so reviews helped. Now, anyone can hear for themselves if an album is good via streaming services. So the review exists purely for deep critical analysis, which is frankly a niche interest. The audience, particularly for the essayist reviews at Pitchfork, are mostly hardcore music fans unpacking meaning, rather than ordinary people working out if it’s any good. And those fans now often vociferously fight back, despite the critic rarely being combative, or in Mapes’s case, even in opposition to them. (Sometimes the artists do, too: Lizzo and Halsey publicly confronted reviewer Rawiya Kameir over her Pitchfork reviews of their respective latest albums.) These attacks are provoked by the absolutism of stan culture. Stans have a devotion to their stars that is truly religious, and, like other religions, their faith can be a powerful framework for self-definition and focusing beliefs; being a fan means being part of a community of like-minded disciples that you may have struggled to find before, and that is intensely meaningful. It can also lead to being blinkered and dogmatic. Like Abraham’s sacrifice or genuflection before a pope, adherent stans make public demonstrations of their faith, with the architecture of social media privileging the boldest voices. This is how we end up with harassed critics, as stans out-nasty one another. Sometimes their actions hurt the very artists they purport to love – Charli XCX was left feeling desperate after her stans criticised her setlist choices: “To everyone commenting all this negative shit I don’t really know what to say. I’m trying my best out here.” All this is what comes after the delight at having a public voice. Previously it was a small number of people in print media (often middle-class white men like me) who got to pass down judgment on albums – on anything, really. Social media gave a voice to everyone, and while it enfranchised huge segments of a silenced population, our culture is still adapting to the cacophony: free speech means you can say what you like, but it doesn’t mean you should. We’re in the acting-out-toddler phase of our collective social media growth, and I’m sure that attacks such as the one on Mapes will become seen as embarrassing as we get older, because they’re the behaviour of an elitist earlier generation: the one that tried to silence other voices. No one should be sending hateful missives to people they don’t know, of course, though their hate is fanned by the very nature of social media. As William Davies says in his recent London Review of Books essay Who Am I Prepared to Kill?, “the online public sphere remains intoxicated by the prospect of the unambiguous baddie, whose condemnation will absolve others of all sin”; in other words, people love a pile-on, because they’re not being piled on themselves. Davies also notes that you can show appreciation with a like on Twitter, but criticism there is shown in “outbursts of denunciation”. This toxic sphere has also turned popularity from a concept to a metric. Twitter likes are just one of the scores that fill our lives, from an education system steadfastly obsessed with grading, to credit ratings, Fitbit or Strava data, and Instagram influencers, for whom follower counts correlate with a higher bank balance. Metacritic’s ranking table, however innocently, is a part of this brutally quantified world – and antithetical to the spirit of artistic expression. (Sport is different, by the way: the score is the whole point, which stops it being toxic, though I can see there are similar problems in scoring music and scoring, say, gymnastics.) We’re a species given to taxonomy, lining up our stuff in rows and putting it in boxes; I get a kick out of Top 100 music lists and commissioned one just recently, of UK No 1 singles. Part of the fun is the absurd way the objectivity of numbers clashes with the subjectivity of music. The Guardian, of course, commissions album and film reviews with star ratings each week. But for some of the score-keeping stans on the touchline of our culture, this numbers game has become what music is chiefly about. As well as the nasty attacks, I’m troubled by how the actual music seems to crouch beneath the hail of anti-critical discourse, ignored; how Metacritic boils down reams of criticism to a number, and how an obsession with Pitchfork’s finicky scoring can end up drowning out the music. This is the bean-counting stuff of capital, not art."
